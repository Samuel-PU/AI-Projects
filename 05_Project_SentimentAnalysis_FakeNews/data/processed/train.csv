"Celebrities Join Tax March in Protest of Donald Trump
Thousands are taking the streets to protest President Donald Trump on Tax Day.

The so-called Tax March is smaller in scale than the Women’s March that drew an estimated 5+ million protesters worldwide following Trump’s inauguration in January, but still drawing vocal crowds across the country.

Those protesting today are primarily calling for Trump to disclose his tax returns. During his candidacy, Trump promised he would release his taxes after the IRS completed their audit of them. He has not. (Note, Trump’s 2016 taxes will immediately be under audit this year.)

Critics believe that Trump’s tax returns may disclose personal or financial ties that influenced the presidential campaign and/or the current administration. This comes as a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation is underway looking at ties between top Trump aides and Russia.

Popular on Variety

As with the Women’s March, some celebrities are protesting via social media. Here are some of their responses.

At a rally in New York City, Sarah Silverman addressed Trump directly. “Show us your f–king taxes, you emotional child.”

13 director Ava Duvernay shared photos of various signs, including one that echoed Silverman’s expletive and another with a “Game of Thrones” reference.

“Captain America” star Chris Evans simply posted “liar” and a clip to an interview where Trump said he would release his taxes.

"Cindy Crawford's daughter Kaia Gerber wears a wig after dining with Harry Styles
We'd venture to say that Cindy Crawford's daughter Kaia Gerber has had it pretty good as a brunette, especially since she inherited that brown hair — and the rest of her features — from her supermodel mom.

But the 14-year-old seems to be testing the waters of being a blonde, posting a picture on Instagram yesterday of herself with piecey platinum locks.

It's not a permanent new 'do, though — she assured her followers it was 'just a lil wig', adding a smiley face emoticon.

Trying a new 'do! Kaia Gerber showed off a short blonde wig on Instagram on Thursday

Real hair: The 14-year-old has long, brown locks that tumble down to her waist — quite like her mom's

Twins! Kaia often draws comparisons to her mother, and had the same features — and same long legs — as the supermodel

With her slicked locks and bold, dark brows, the young model looks a whole lot more like singer Rita Ora than her lookalike mom in the one-off picture.

At shoulder length, the wig is much shorter than her real hair, too, which usually tumbles down to her waist.

Kaia shared the picture just hours after letting her brown locks flow for a lunch with her mom and One Direction star Harry Styles .

Stopping by Cafe Habana in Malibu for a catch-up, the 22-year-old singer could be seen enjoying a meal and with the supermodel, 50, her husband Rande Gerber, and Kaia.

Harry — who has previously visited the Crawford/Gerber clan at their home — looked pleased to be spending some of his downtime catching up with old friends in California.

Arriving at the family's table in the upmarket Cuban and Mexican eatery, the One Direction star was greeted with a warm embrace and a kiss on the cheek from world-famous beauty.

Earlier that day: Kaia had enjoyed lunch with her parents and One Directioner Harry Styles on Thursday

"Here's What Really Happened When JFK Jr. Met Princess Diana
During the summer of 1995, John F. Kennedy Jr. secretly met Princess Diana in New York, and ever since, there has been much speculation over exactly what happened in her suite at the Carlyle Hotel that day.

According to RoseMarie Terenzio, JFK Jr.’s executive assistant who accompanied him to the hotel that day, the hour and half-long meeting in Diana’s suite was way more innocent than those rumors would have you believe, People reports.

The two simply talked about Diana appearing on the cover of JFK Jr.’s political magazine George, but organizing the meeting wasn’t easy at all.

“I remember him saying, ‘There’s no way someone is not going to leak it. There’s going to be paparazzi everywhere,’” Terenzio said. “Someone suggested he go in disguise and I said, ‘That’s ridiculous. You’re not doing that!’”

Getty Images Princess Diana leaving the Carlyle Hotel in New York in 1995.

Thankfully JFK Jr. agreed, and he and Terenzio figured out the best way to get into the Carlyle unnoticed.

“I had remembered that the last time I had been to the Carlyle for an event, there had been no photographers at the front entrance,” Terenzio told People. “So I told John, ‘Don’t go in the side entrance, because if anyone does leak it beforehand, people will expect you to go in the side. So walk in the front door.’”

Turns out Terenzio was right and the two celebrities walked straight into the hotel while the photographers were camped out at the side door.

Even though JFK Jr. had a “respectful piece” in mind, according to Terenzio, the story never ended up happening.

“She wrote John a note that said, ‘Thank you so much, but not right now,'” Terenzio recalls.

After the meeting, JFK Jr. ""was very careful what he said,"" George magazine creative director Matt Berman told People. “The one funny thing he said was, ‘She’s got a great pair of legs.’”

While he might not have mentioned that to his assistant, “I do remember him saying","1"

"Taylor Swift Reportedly Reacts To Tom Hiddleston’s Golden Globes Win
Taylor Swift has reportedly reacted to news of her ex-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston’s recent win at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards.

Shortly after Sunday night’s awards show in Los Angeles, a source claimed Taylor Swift has learned news of Hiddleston’s award, which he received for his work in The Night Manager and insisted that the singer was completely happy for her former partner.

“[Taylor Swift] is happy for Tom’s win,” a source told Hollywood Life on January 9. “She didn’t really see his speech or watch the show. It wasn’t appointment television for her to see Tom and others she has dated.”

When Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston broke up months ago, rumors swirled in regard to possible arguments and tension over their highly-publicized relationship. However, according to the Hollywood Life source, Taylor Swift holds no ill will for her ex-boyfriend.

As for Taylor Swift’s decision against watching the awards show, the source claimed the Golden Globes simply weren’t something she was focused on. That said, she reportedly believes Hiddleston deserved the award he received.

“[Taylor Swift] likes being part of award shows but if she has no part of it she chooses to not focus much attention on it. But she is happy that Tom won, she feels that it was well deserved,” the source explained.

Taylor Swift began dating Tom Hiddleston in June of last year, just weeks after her relationship with Calvin Harris came to an end after 15 months, and right away, several photos of the former couple on the beach together hit the web. Then, for weeks, Taylor Swift’s romance with Hiddleston continued to be documented with photos of the two of them in several different countries, including the U.K., Italy, and Australia.

"For The Love Of God, Why Can't Anyone Write Kate McKinnon A Good Movie Role?
Kate McKinnon in ""The Spy Who Dumped Me."" Lionsgate

Consider this a call to arms. Kate McKinnon needs our help.

You see, the “Saturday Night Live” MVP is the only full-time cast member in the show’s 43-year history to win two Emmys. From Bieber impressions to alien abductions, she is its deft quarterback, its kooky crown jewel, its melodic moral compass ― every bit as essential to the lineup as Kristen Wiig or Amy Poehler or Eddie Murphy or John Belushi.

Why, then, on God’s sin-ridden earth, can no one write her a good movie role?

Seeing as McKinnon is the best part of anything she’s in, it can be easy to forget she’s never had a good role. That’s because she’s, well, Kate McKinnon, able to elevate characters that otherwise coast on one-note hijinks. Often, they’re not so much characters as they are walking punch lines: the whimsical engineer in “Ghostbusters,” the buttoned-up HR coordinator in “Office Christmas Party,” the bossy redneck in “Masterminds,” the Australian madcap in “Rough Night” and now the adventurous unemployed actress in “The Spy Who Dumped Me.”

All of these roles play out the same way. McKinnon is a sidekick to more established movie stars, introduced as the eccentric friend, wife or colleague with an odd collection of life experiences that act as a stand-in for character development. As Holtz in “Ghostbusters,” she’s a “gluten-full” skier who somehow put a physicist in a coma. As Pippa in “Rough Night,” she’s an animal whisperer who once perished and came back to life during a drug trip in the desert. As the buffoonish Jandice in “Masterminds,” her husband died from a snake bite; at his funeral, she fell in love with his “distant cousin.”

And as Morgan in “The Spy Who Dumped Me,” her biography includes getting deported from Belize, doing cocaine with her basketball coach, being the target of Mandy Patinkin’s advances, discussing penis preferences wit","1"

"Angelina Jolie Can’t Get Over Heartbreak Of Losing Brad Pitt — Real Reason For Fury, Says Source
Angelina Jolie, 43, “really hasn’t come to terms with her heartbreak” over her split from Brad Pitt, 54, a source close to the Maleficent actress EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “She’s not in a place where she want to admit, it but the loss of their love is still haunting her. They had such a passionate love affair. It’s not something that’s easy for her to get over, not without a fight to match the size of their love. The fact is, Angelina’s deeply hurt that they couldn’t keep things together and have their happy Hollywood ending and she puts all the blame for that failure on Brad.”

Perhaps this explains the nasty turn Brad and Angelina’s custody battle has taken, with her lobbing allegations of unpaid child support at her ex. “Instead of facing her sadness and working through it,” the source tells HollywoodLife.com, “her coping mechanism is to go full ice queen. Sadly it is the only way she can get through this divorce. If she doesn’t focus on her anger and stay in that frame of mind, she would crumble and possibly even have a breakdown.”

“That’s just not an option” for Angie, the source added. “She has to stay strong for her kids and unfortunately for Brad, ‘staying strong’ means ‘staying angry.’ “ Angie’s anger, while helping her keep it together for her kids, but actually backfire and cost her the one thing she’s trying to protect. Angelina’s “carefully word-smithed” accusation – where she claimed Brad didn’t pay “meaningful” child support – might come off as insincere to the judge overseeing the case, California family law attorney David Pisarra EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. “I wouldn’t be surprised if it backfires on her, as more and more judges are starting to see through these tactics quicker.”

"Despacito
2017 single by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee

Not to be confused with Despacio

""Despacito"" (Latin American Spanish: [despaˈsito]; transl. ""Slowly"") is a song by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi, originally written in 2015. In 2016, Luis sent the song to Puerto Rican rapper and singer Daddy Yankee to give it an ""urban injection"", and released it as the lead single from Fonsi's 2019 studio album Vida.[1][2]

Released on January 13, 2017, the song was written by Fonsi, Erika Ender, and Daddy Yankee, and produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres.[1] A remix version featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, which helped to improve the chart performance of the song in numerous countries, including various number-one positions. ""Despacito"" has been widely credited by music journalists as being instrumental in the renewed popularity of Spanish-language pop music in the mainstream market.

It is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time with lyrics about desiring a sexual relationship, performed in a smooth and romantic way. ""Despacito"" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the fusion between Latin and urban rhythms, its catchiness, and its text painting. It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. ""Despacito"" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop-music history.

The song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of six others. In the United States, it became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since Los del Río's ""Macarena"" in 1996, subsequently tying the longest-reigning number one on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time with 16 weeks, as well as becoming the lo","1"

You learn something new every day — like the fact that Blake Shelton does not want Gwen Stefani talking about their relationship on The Voice. In a preview clip for the hit NBC series’ season 12, debuting Monday, February 27, the four judges reveal their biggest musical influences growing up and give a hint of what’s to come during the upcoming competition. Spoiler alert: It involves puppets.

“What got me into music is, I think, what got us all into music — music playing all around you when you were a kid,” Alicia Keys says. “My mother had a pretty impressive record collection, and I remember Sundays being a time when a lot of music was played.” Keys is basically right, since Adam Levine credits his parents buying a single for him that he played “every single day.” And Shelton says his brother influenced his own taste by default; because his brother played his music so loud, Shelton had no choice but to listen to it as well.

Only Stefani cites something other than family as inspiring her early on. “My biggest musical inspiration was The Sound of Music,” she reveals. “It inspired me in music and in fashion and for the rest of my life.” The bubbly blonde also added that the show doesn’t have “any kind of boundaries, so anything can go.” Considering her romance with Shelton, that seems like an accurate statement … but he doesn’t want to talk about it.

While trying to persuade a contestant to team up with her in a preview clip from an upcoming episode, Stefani notes, “I just did a country song with Blake Shelton, so I’ve got the hookup!”

The time-jumping family drama scored 11 total nominations — including best drama series, the first time a broadcast series has cracked the category since 2011.

""The emails are flying!"" Fogelman told THR early Thursday. ""We're so busy right now that there's not a lot of time to think … the feed was freezing and we didn't quite understand what was happening. People were texting us ahead of us understanding what was going on!""

Fogelman noted that the way This Is Us is filmed — with members of the family working together in different scenes at any given time and not a lot of group scenes — will make getting the whole group together to celebrate complicated. ""There hasn't been a lot of planning! I need to figure out how to get everyone together in some way — I've never done this before!"" the first-time nominee enthused. The busy producer was on his way to film on location Thursday and planned to find a way to head to the show's L.A. set to celebrate properly with the production.

"7 Weird Details About Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn's Relationship
When it comes to Taylor Swift, it’s impossible to talk about her career without also talking about her relationships, as she uses each and every one as inspiration for her songs.

“It’s individual people that come into my life,” Swift has said in the past when talking about where she finds inspiration for her lyrics. “When I first started writing songs, I was always scared that my songs were too personal, like, if I put someone’s name in a song, people won’t relate to it as much. But what I saw happening was, if I let my fans into my life and my feelings and what I’m going through my vulnerabilities, my fears, my insecurities it turns out they have all those things, too, and it kind of connects us.”

Lawrence said that reading the reviews made her be extra protective of him, so she had to put an end to it. “I finally was just like, ‘It’s not healthy. Neither of us are doing it because if I read it, I start getting defensive.’ Especially because it’s my man,” she said. “It’s awesome, what we did — some people hate it and the people who hate it, really hate it. But it’s nothing that needs to be defended and if I read a negative review, I just feel defensive.”

Cheer up Kristen you're dating Robert Pattinson! Stewart is usual scowling self on night out



Really, what has she got to be so sullen about?

Kristen Stewart is dating one of the hottest guys in Hollywood, has a stellar career and millions of dollars in the bank.

Yet she still seems unable to raise a smile.



The 20-year-old actress had her usual scowl on her face - and ever-present cigarette in hand - as she went for a date with Robert Pattinson last night in Beverly Hills.

Ray of sunshine: Kristen Stewart was her usual scowling self on a date with Robert Pattinson in Beverly Hills last night



Pained: Stewart caused controversy earlier this year when she drew parallels between being photographed by paparazzi and being raped



Stewart obviously feels comfortable around Pattinson as she didn't bother dressing up at all, wearing a grey hoodie, no make-up and her scraggly unwashed hair hung limply around her face. Pattinson was his usual amiable, grinning self but Stewart couldn't even manage a smile, choosing instead to glare at her boyfriend as she puffed on her cigarette. The couple went for a sushi dinner at Hollywood hotspot Matsuhisa before hurrying into their waiting car and speeding off into the night.

Ducking down: Robert Pattinson was at least able to raise a smile as the couple were driven away



Twenty-year-old Stewart claims to have a lot to be unhappy about. Despite a career, boyfriend and bank balance that millions of mere mortals would kill for,the Twilight star does nothing but bemoan her privileged status. In an interview with Blackbook magazine last year she compared her life to that of Pattinson's character, Edward Cullen, in the hit vampire movies. RELATED ARTICLES Previous

"Johnny Depp Settles Lawsuit Against His Former Business Managers
Johnny Depp’s legal wrangling with his former managers has finally concluded, with the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star reaching a settlement with The Management Group.

In a statement issued Monday, a spokesperson for the actor said, “Johnny Depp is pleased to have achieved a settlement agreement with The Management Group following the legal action he took against the company in January 2017.”

The spokesperson added, “The lawsuit taken out against The Management Group – and the subsequent settlement – is a further demonstration that Johnny is determined to take firm action to protect his personal and artistic reputation in the interests of his family and his career.”

The spokesperson added that, with a settlement reached, Depp will be able to fully focus on his various projects.

“Following the settlement, Johnny is pleased to be able to revert his full attention to his ongoing artistic endeavors, notably the second leg of the sold-out Hollywood Vampires global tour and the exciting launch of J.K. Rowling’s ‘Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,’ which will be released in theaters in November this year.”

Depp initially sued The Management Group in January 2017, accusing his former managers of “self-dealing and gross misconduct.” Among the misdeeds that Depp, who sought $25 million, alleged: Taking a 5 percent commission of the actor’s income, “in some cases regardless of whether Mr. Depp actually received any income himself or not” — a commission that was “exorbitant, excessive, and far outstripped the actual value of services TMG would be performing for Mr. Depp.”

The management company subsequently filed a cross-complaint, accusing Depp of living “an ultra-extravagant lifestyle” that he “simply could not afford.”

“[T]hroughout the entire 17-year period that TMG represented Depp, Depp lived an ultra-extravagant lifestyle that knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2 million per month to maintai","1"

Swift calls out label for being 'nervous' over pop album

A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.

""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""

Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.

""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""

With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.

""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""

Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.

""How do you not know how awesome you are?"" Nicolle Wallace asked.

""I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times,"" said Swift.","1"

While Selena's journey has included its fair share of ups and downs, it's worth noting that the 27-year-old actress and singer just experienced a lot of the same things that many women in their 20s go through; friends coming and going, relationships falling apart (and rekindling), doing a little partying, and even getting tattoos.

"Ben Affleck & Jennifer Garner File For Divorce Amid Reconciliation Rumors
LOADING ERROR LOADING

It took them two years, a superhero franchise and a countless trips to the Brentwood farmer’s market, but Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have officially filed for divorce.

The couple apparently coordinated their filing sans lawyers, according to TMZ, which was first to break the news, with Garner sending her court papers in Thursday and Affleck responding shortly after.

The two are seeking joint legal and physical custody of their children, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 4, so it looks like they’re avoiding a Brangelina-style situation entirely.

The decision to officially divorce comes amid speculation that the former Hollywood golden twosome were reconciling, as the two have continued to act very much like a couple (going on vacations together, praising each other in the press and co-parenting their children) since announcing their split in June 2015.

But according to sources per People magazine, Garner and Affleck have taken their sweet time to iron out the details, like division of property and assets, as well as spousal support, since they do not have a prenuptial agreement.

The two reportedly remain “super amicable” and have done everything with their children in mind.

“They always planned to divorce despite what people said. If you look at their first statement it says divorce, not separate,” a source told the magazine. “They just did it the way they wanted to and did what was best for their kids. There was no catalyst, it was just time. Nothing has changed, they are and still will be putting their kids first.”","1"

Josh Duhamel, 45, and Jennifer Garner, 45, are the same age, they’re both in the business and they’re both single. So, when rumors began to swirl that the two Hollywood A-listers were dating, fans went wild. However, you can pump the breaks on that one, because, although Duhamel thinks his Love, Simon co-star is “incredible,” he’s laughing off those pesky dating rumors. “It does truly amaze me what some of the things that are printed,” Duhamel told E! News at the premiere of the movie in Los Angeles on March 13. “It’s like, how is that even legal? I try not to comment on it. It is what it is and it’s part of the business. We’re in the circus and that’s part of being in the circus.”

While Duhamel is not dating Garner, their friendship is thriving — Hence their chemistry on-screen. “Her kids weren’t on set, neither were mine. We were only there for I think, a week and a half, two weeks, working, but I went to Jen a couple times asking advice on certain things and she’s an incredible woman, she really is,” Duhamel revealed. “She’s very, very smart. She’s a lot funnier than I think people realize.”

The two star in the new drama, Love, Simon, where they play the parents of a gay teenage son named Simon, played by Nick Robinson. Simon has kept his sexuality secret, even from his family. Meanwhile, he has fallen in love with a fellow, anonymous closeted classmate after exchanging emails with them. Then a blackmailer finds the emails and threatens to out Simon.

Although Duhamel may not be romancing Garner, another report claims he is smitten with another actress. He’s reportedly dating Eiza González, 28, , according to Us Weekly, which claims the two met at Jennifer Lopez‘s pre-Super Bowl concert.

"Did Miley Cyrus get mad at Liam Hemsworth for refusing to wear his promise ring?
Miley Cyrus’ new album, Younger Now, is set to release next month. So far we have three songs and I’m not in love with any of them. I’m meh on Younger Now but I find Malibu and Inspired practically unlistenable. There’s a few left to release, though, including Rainbowland featuring her godmother, Dolly Parton. I’m sure one of them will appeal to me.

Anyway, with all this new music coming out, people are once again wondering if Miley and fiancé Liam Hemsworth will ever walk down the aisle. I maintain that the speculation is as much the couple’s doing as the press. I think Miley likes us talking about her and she knows this is one thing fans will never tired of. However, if Life & Style is to be believed, it goes much deeper than that. L&S claims that Miley pitched a major fit over Liam not wearing his promise ring and the fight grew loud before she gave him the silent treatment for almost two days.

When Miley Cyrus channeled her inner Beyoncé and put a ring on longtime boyfriend Liam Hemsworth, it was supposed to be a sign of their commitment to each other. There was just one small problem: the Australian actor refused to wear it. That did not sit well with Miley, 24, and sources reveal exclusively to Life & Style that the piece of jewelry became the subject of a nasty shouting match. “She pushed him and pushed him to wear the ring,” the insider says, “and she finally lost her temper and was screaming at him furiously. The fight was one of the worst they’ve ever had.” The former Disney star was so mad she actually threw her phone to the ground and smashed it. “She refused to talk to him for almost two days after that,” the source adds. Liam, 27, has since apologized and agreed to wear the promise ring. He was recently spotted out with the hardware on that finger, prompting wedding rumors.

Fake rumours emerged this week that the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, had died following an influx of Twitter users falsely speculating he had passed away.

According to The Sun, the Queen was furious with the rumours, and even called her 97-year-old husband to discuss how they could stop it happening in future.

A source told The Sun: ""They both agreed there was little they could do but they are very, very annoyed.

“It’s not nice to hear people the world over commenting on your health or death, even if you’re used to being in the public eye.

“The Queen is absolutely fuming over this and thinks it’s disgraceful.”

The Queen, 92, is currently on holiday at Craigowen Lodge in Balmoral while the Duke stays at Sandringham.

The source added that if Prince Philip was ill, that the Queen would be at his side rather than away in Scotland.

OK! Online have contacted Buckingham Palace for comment.

Prince Philip celebrated turning 97 years old on June 10, 2018, and officially retired from royal duties in 2017 at 96 years of age.

The last time the public saw Prince Philip was two weeks after his birthday, on June 24, 2018, when he stepped out with the Queen for the Royal Windsor Cup Polo match in Egham.

Prior to that Prince Philip joined the Queen and the royal family at the wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on May 18, 2018.

"Ryan Seacrest Relieved Kim Kardashian to Fill in For Kelly Ripa On Live!
Ryan Seacrest is breathing a huge sigh of relief. That’s because Kim Kardashian will be filling in for Kelly Ripa for an episode of Kelly and Ryan Live!. This will be Kim’s first time co-hosting with Ryan but her second time on the show. She previously co-hosted Live! with Kelly Ripa back in 2012.

Many viewers believe that there might be some behind-the-scenes friction between Ryan Seacrest and Kelly Ripa. That’s because Ryan might not be focusing on their television show. Even though he’s in New York City every weekday to tape his Live! episodes with Kelly, he’s also hosting his radio show in Los Angeles. If that weren’t enough, Ryan will also be forced to travel to Orlando every week to hot the new reboot of American Idol. With so many different projects, many fans feel that Ryan might be stretching himself too thin.

Sooner or later Ryan will be forced to drop one of his gigs. Of course, the last thing Kelly would want to see is him quit Live!. She already spent the last year looking for a suitable replacement for her ex co-host Michael Strahan and she doesn’t want to spend another year looking for someone to take Ryan’s place, too.

That’s not the only problem between Ryan and Kelly right now. Many observers also believe there’s also another issue that Kelly might have and that’s with Kim Kardashian. With Kim, fans either absolutely love her or they hate her. There’s no in between. And the last thing Kelly Ripa wants do is alienate her audience. Both Kelly and Ryan have had a hard time keeping audiences tuned in as it is.

The show’s ratings are nowhere near what it used to be before. And with Kim on the show, it might go one of two ways: either fans will tune in because they’ll want to see if Kim has what it takes to successfully host a show or they’ll tune out altogether. After all, everyone still remembers how Kim’s mother Kris Jenner tried to host her own daytime talk show herself. Her","1"

The past couple months have been devastating for anyone who follows the love lives of the Hollywood elite. Iconic couples — from Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan to John Cena and Nikki Bella — have been calling it quits left and right. And this morning, Twitter was on fire with speculation that another famous couple was on the way to Splitsville — Victoria and David Beckham! *GASP* What? Noooooo. So, are David and Victoria Beckham divorcing? The answer is no, according to a statement David's rep gave to Mirror Online.

""There is no statement due or divorce,"" the rep said, slamming the rumors with one sentence. ""This is just fake social media news. This is all very bizarre and an embarrassing waste of time."" Elite Daily reached out to David's team for comment on the report, but did not hear back by the time of publication.

How did these rumors start? Well, does it really matter? It seems like rumors that David and Victoria are divorcing pop up every other year. So it seems we're right on schedule.

But, just for your information, it seems the spark that lit the fire under this round of speculation came when whispers that David was cheating on Victoria with their daughter, Harper's, teacher (and that she's supposedly now pregnant with his child) hit Twitter. Elite Daily reached out to David and Victoria's teams for comment on the cheating rumors, but did not hear back by the time of publication.

According to Mirror Online, ""bookies suspended betting on news of them splitting following thousands of tweets claiming the couple would be putting out a statement."" Which, is, like, the saddest sentence I've ever read. Who bets on the downfall of someone's marriage?! Come on now. Be better.

Taylor Swift is doing a lot to promote her new album, Reputation. Aside from the singles and music videos, the singer also released behind-the-scenes videos, branded UPS delivery trucks, and invited fans over for private listening parties. Next in the line-up is her special Reputation magazines, which Target will release on Friday, the same day as her album.

Swift's been teasing her personalized publications on social media since she announced her upcoming record. They include handwritten lyrics, personal polaroids, and paintings by the singer.





However, some fans noticed a few details in the magazines that have less to do with Swift's creative process. She shared the back covers of the publications today, revealing they're designed to look like celebrity tabloid magazine covers.

Taylor Swift / Instagram Story

Taylor Swift / Instagram Story

Fans noticed the headlines parody real tabloid stories about the star. The one titled ""Who Is Olivia's Real Father?"" is a playful reference to her cat but also appears to mock one OK! story that reported she was pregnant with the headline, ""Who's The Dad?"" Her second cover, with the headline, ""Why She Disappeared,"" seems to mimic an Us Weekly issue with the same title.

As Buzzfeed points out, Swift even got the logos down. Her ""TS Swiftly"" emblem looks like Us Weekly's, while her ""TS!!"" one resembles OK!'s.



The cover art for Swift's new album, filled with faux headlines and newspaper clippings, also references the theme of clapping back at critics and other real-life celebrity frenemies. While some praise the singer for ""taking back the narrative,"" others disapprove of her attack on the media, which one Cosmo article notes is reflective of Trump's relationship with the press.

Swifties, however, have firmly aligned themselves with the former camp.

"Eddie Cibrian Cheated On Both LeAnn Rimes & Brandi Glanville — Report
In a new interview with RadarOnline.com, Scheana, 27, claims that Eddie, 39, contacted her after he split with Brandi, 40, in 2009. According to the waitress, who now stars on Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules, Eddie was already dating LeAnn, 30.

“As months go by, Eddie gets separated. He then contacts me to go out for drinks,” Scheana says. “I believed he was separated, so I was happy to go out with him again. But shortly into trying to hang out with him I find out about LeAnn, and I felt like such an idiot!”

Scheana Marie Recalls Meeting Eddie Cibrian

Scheana spoke with the website about when she first met Eddie and revealed the surprising source who informed her about Eddie’s lies. “Originally, I met him seven years ago. When a really good-looking guy with big dimples wants to take you out for drinks your first question isn’t ‘Are you married because you don’t have a ring on your finger?'” she says.

“We hung out, it was quite casual and about six months in, my mom saw an article and was like, ‘That Eddie guy you are dating, is his last name Cibrian and is he on Third Watch?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, what do you hear?’ And she told me that he and his wife are expecting their second child!”

Scheana Confronts Eddie About His Lies

Scheana says that she confronted the philandering actor to find out the truth, and he admitted to his lies via text message! “He was like, ‘I’m so sorry I lied to you.’ He then switched the conversation and said, ‘By the way, are you still doing the acting thing? I have a project I’m funding, and there’s a role for you that would be great.'”

The waitress-turned-reality star says that, since their last run-in, she and Eddie haven’t spoken. “I have no interest in talking to him again,” she says.

Do you believe Scheana’s claims that Eddie tried to cheat on LeAnn with her, HollywoodLifers?

"Of course, the Oscars had plenty of political moments
Washington CNN —

It wouldn’t be an awards show without some political moments.

This year, we kept track of every political jab and line made at the 90th annual Academy Awards show. Check out the list below:

On the carpet

Fashion as a political statement

Tonight, actors and allies will #WearOrange pins and ribbons on the #Oscars red carpet to bring awareness to gun violence prevention in the wake of the Parkland school shooting. https://t.co/7BxtM6bTKD — Everytown (@Everytown) March 4, 2018

As expected, many attendees sported the signature “Time’s up” black and white pin.

Another popular pin spotted on the carpet? #WearOrange pins and ribbons from gun control group Everytown. They were worn in an effort to raise awareness about gun safety.

Puerto Rico still on the mind

During an interview with Michael Strahan, “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda encouraged viewers to visit Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricane.

“Keep Puerto Rico in the conversation. I know there’s no shortage of things in the news, but keep Puerto Rico in your hearts,” Miranda said.

He added that tourism is “the lifeblood” of Puerto Rico, and urged people to “spend money there.”

On average, 87% of the island has power, but sources told CNN that about 150,000 US citizens on the island still don’t have electricity. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has repeatedly expressed frustration at the slow pace of recovery and help. He has questioned the US Army Corps of Engineers’ response on the island compared with other states dealing with disaster.

"Kim Kardashian Apparently Can’t Wait Until Khloé Leaves Tristan Thompson

Kim Kardashian just wants her sisters to be happy and healthy, which is why she’s wishing for the end of Khloé’s relationship with her cheating boyfriend and baby daddy, Tristan Thompson. According to the Hollywood Life, Kim is “counting down the days” until Khloé and baby True get the hell out of Cleveland and return home to Calabasas.

Ever since news broke that Tristan had cheated on Khloé, just days before she gave birth to their daughter, reports about Khloé’s well-being have been contradictory: Does she feel like she’s “living in hell?” Is she trying to make things work? Is she lying about everything?

One person who has been explicit and steadfast in her sentiments is her sister Kim, who last month called the whole scenario “fucked up.” And, according to a source close to the Kardashians who spoke to Hollywood Life, Kim’s feelings haven’t changed.

“Kim is counting down the days ’til Khloe gets her shit together and kicks Tristan to the curb,” the source said. “It’s driving Kim insane that Khloe is still with Tristan because she deserves so much more. But Kim knows that she can’t tell Khloe what to do — she has to make that decision alone.”

The source also revealed that Kim has been trying to convince Khloé to go to “intensive therapy” to help her with her “chronically low self-esteem.”

The source continued, “Until she fixes that issue, she’s going to continue to fall in love with men that aren’t emotionally available and giving.”

Which reminds us … how are things going for Kim and Kanye?","1"

"Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston’s second wedding joy
In the wake of her high-profile split to Brad Pitt in 2005, Jennifer Aniston said: ‘What’s fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person, and looking across the room and saying, ‘I’m still here, and I still love you’.’

‘You have marriages within marriages…that’s what I want in marriage,’ she added at the time.

The now 49-year-old actress and her ex-husband Brad Pitt, who reunited shortly after Jen split from Justin Theroux in early 2018, have decided to give their failed marriage a second chance.

Multiple insiders told In Touch, ‘They are taking the biggest leap possible.’

Adding, ‘Their shared dream of coming full circle, marrying again, is coming true.’

‘They are aiming for an August ceremony and reception at George Clooney’s villa in Lake Como, Italy,’ a source spills to In Touch.

Brad’s longtime friend George, who let John Krasinski and Emily Blunt marry at his 18th-century estate in 2010, ‘would be more than happy to host the nuptials.’

Unlike their 2000 wedding, which reportedly cost $1million, this second wedding joy will be ‘smaller and more intimate,’ according to friends.

Jen hopes to have a maximum of 14 guests, including George and wife Amal, best friend Courtney Cox and the six children Brad shares with estranged wife Angelina Jolie – Maddox, 16, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9 – for what an insider calls a ‘classy, white-themed wedding.’

"Ewan McGregor Scraps UK Talk Show Visit Over Piers Morgan Women’s March Barbs
UPDATE, WRITETHRU with more detail: Shortly before he was due to appear on ITV’s Good Morning Britain today, Ewan McGregor pulled out of the interview, citing comments made about this weekend’s Women’s March by host Piers Morgan. A supporter of President Donald Trump, Morgan yesterday on the program described some of the women who marched as “rabid feminists” and said he didn’t “see the point of the march(es)” which he called “generic” and “vacuous.”

On Twitter this morning, McGregor, who is out promoting Trainspotting sequel T2: Trainspotting, wrote, “Was going on Good Morning Britain, didn’t realise Piers Morgan was host. Won’t go on with him after his comments about #WomensMarch.”

Was going on Good Morning Britain, didn’t realise @piersmorgan was host. Won’t go on with him after his comments about #WomensMarch — Ewan McGregor (@mcgregor_ewan) January 24, 2017

On his Twitter account (whose timeline photo is of he and Trump), Morgan responded by saying McGregor is “just an actor after all.”

Watch on Deadline

Sorry to hear that @mcgregor_ewan – you should be big enough to allow people different political opinions. You’re just an actor after all. — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 24, 2017

Morgan also tweeted he expected McGregor was reacting to his Monday column in the Daily Mail in which he called himself “a feminist,” but decried comments made by Madonna on Saturday saying, “I can’t abide the feminazis, the radical, extreme feminists like Madonna.”

On Tuesday, Morgan took to the middle-market UK tabloid to launch a vicious attack on McGregor where he referred to the actor as “unprofessional” and “disingenuous.”

“An actor who had contractually agreed to appear on a TV show to promote his new film pulls out at the last minute because he doesn’t like the political opinion of one of the presenters,” said Morgan.

"Brad Pitt: A Life So Large




Published in the June/July 2013 issue of Esquire.

Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away. He'll try to hold on to its outlines, but your features will suffer an inexorable erasure, and the next time he sees you you'll be brand-new to him. He used to try tricking those he'd forgotten into thinking he remembered them, or at least waiting them out for a clue or scrap of context. But then he decided to experiment.

""So many people hate me because they think I'm disrespecting them,"" he says. ""So I swear to God, I took one year where I just said, This year, I'm just going to cop to it and say to people, 'Okay, where did we meet?' But it just got worse. People were more offended. Every now and then, someone will give me context, and I'll say, 'Thank you for helping me.' But I piss more people off. You get this thing, like, 'You're being egotistical. You're being conceited.' But it's a mystery to me, man. I can't grasp a face and yet I come from such a design/aesthetic point of view. I am going to get it tested.""

He is convinced he has that thing, that condition he read about a few years ago. What's it called? Is he pronouncing it right? That's it: prosopagnosia. It's gotten to the point where he doesn't even like going out — ""that's why I stay at home"" — but he's also a public person, the center of crowds. ""You meet so many damned people,"" he says. ""And then you meet 'em again.""

And so, if you ever meet Brad Pitt, you should know a few things: He'll probably forget you. He'll probably worry about forgetting you. He'll probably worry that you'll think he's an asshole for forgetting you. And then he'll probably do or say something that will inspire you to tell people that you just met Brad Pitt, ","1"
"Are Drew Barrymore and Will Kopelman Back Together?
It’s that time of year — where love is clearly in the air! And even Drew Barrymore isn’t safe! The Blended star was spotted getting cozy with ex-husband Will Kopelman, leaving the world wondering if they are getting back together? The couple, who split in 2016 after four years of marriage, have been spending nights together, an insider tells In Touch.

“When Drew was filming Santa Clarita Diet, Will would fly into LA from NYC. Even though he had a hotel room, he ended up sleeping at Drew’s house from time to time. Then when she finished shooting in October, it became a more regular thing. They enjoy each other’s company,” revealed the insider.

“They’re both in great places in their lives,” says an insider. Spending so much time together has reminded Drew, 42, and Will, 40 — who share daughters Olive, 5, and Frankie, 3 — of the way things used to be. “It’s like it was at the beginning of their relationship, so relaxed and comfortable,” says the insider, adding that a reconciliation “is a real possibility.”

Drew revealed that she felt like the “biggest failure” after announcing her divorce. “Like, when you get divorced, you break up with somebody and you’re like, ‘Yeah, that didn’t work,’ and you get divorced, [but] when you get divorced you’re like, ‘I’m the biggest failure. This is the biggest failure.’ It’s so shameful and hard to actually go through that, even privately.”

This isn’t the Never Been Kissed star’s first divorce. She was previously married when she was 19 years old to Jeremy Thomas and fellow actor Tom Green in 2001. Both marriages only lasted a year.","1"

"Are Katy Perry & The Weeknd Dating? The Two Got Dinner & Immediately Set Off Rumors
Can music fans expect an amazing ""Starboy""/""Swish Swish"" mashup sometime soon? Katy Perry and The Weeknd recently had dinner together, according to multiple sources. But since the two singers are both currently single — with Perry's breakup from Orlando Bloom and The Weeknd recently splitting from Selena Gomez — could this dinner date be a sign of anything more than a friendship or a possible collaboration going on between the two?

Sources including Glamour UK and Vogue, reported that the two singers had a fashionable dinner date. According to The Sun's report, Perry and The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, dined together in West Hollywood and apparently had a great time with each other. They then reportedly went home separately. The Sun's report suggests that the date between the pair was romantic and not just a dinner between friends, but take that with a grain of salt. Not only are there are no details available from the singers themselves, but other publications are reporting that they simply got dinner, no romance involved.

While many sources have reported on this dinner between Perry and The Weeknd, most outlets have yet to report anything regarding a potential relationship between the pair. Sorry to burst the bubble of any Katy Perry and The Weeknd shippers, but it's probably just a rumor that the two are dating — at least right now.

The Weeknd has found himself linked to a couple of different women after his breakup with Gomez, and it's not likely that he's actually dating every single person he'e seen with. On Nov. 11, Us Weekly reported that he was seen holding hands with Yovanna Ventura, who was previously linked to Justin Bieber, who is currently dating his ex-girlfriend (and The Weeknd's ex-girlfriend, for that matter) Gomez.

Trouble in paradise? Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes were first spotted dancing together in the Hamptons in 2013 — just one year after she split from Tom Cruise. Although Jamie and Katie have never confirmed their romance, they have been spotted on date nights and canoodling plenty of times over the past several years. But recently, tension has been high between them as Jamie is getting a bit jealous of Katie’s friendship with former flame Joshua Jackson.

The 50-year-old Sleepless star was overheard venting about his tumultuous relationship with Katie while hanging out at Coachella. “He didn’t seem to care who heard him,” the source exclusively told In Touch. Jamie admitted that not only was Katie talking to Joshua again, but he was also “hurt” by it.

It’s imprtant to note that Katie and Joshua go way back, which is why Jamie probably “seemed pretty cut up by everything.” The former Dawson’s Creek co-stars dated in the ’90s and Katie admitted during an interview with Rolling Stone in 1998 that Joshua was her first love.

When asked about their relationship, a then 19-year-old Katie said, “I’m just going to say that I met somebody last year, I fell in love, I had my first love, and it was something so incredible and indescribable.” She added, “I feel so fortunate because he’s now one of my best friends. It’s weird, it’s almost like a Dawson-and-Joey type thing now.”

The pair broke things off before Katie went on to date Chris Klein for five years before marrying Tom in 2006. However, Katie and Joshua have always kept in touch despite other relationships. Surprisingly, she reached out to Joshua following her split from Tom in 2012.

“Like any old friend, it was like, ‘Oh, hi, how are ya? What’s going on?’; ‘I had a kid,'” Joshua told a Canadian talk show host about the phone call with Katie. “It was very nice, actually.”

So, does Jamie have a reason to be worried? That’s a tricky question, but Jamie is","1"
"Liam Payne And Cheryl Cole Reportedly Fighting Over Baby Names
Things are changing quickly in Liam Payne and Cheryl Cole's life. They just welcomed their little bundle of joy into the world last week and have shared the amazing news with the world. Both Cheryl and Liam couldn't stop gushing about this new little human in their lives and they are super proud to call themselves parents. However, the former X-Factor judge did reveal that their son doesn't have a moniker yet.

Some reports are stating that Liam and Cheryl could be disagreeing on a name which is why one hasn't been picked out yet. Of course, this is all speculation and no one really knows why the baby doesn't have a name yet except the close family.

But, we did some digging and actually found old interviews where Liam and Cheryl talk about what they would name their future child. These interviews were done separately and before they even started dating. But, they each had completely different ideas when it came to the name.

Could this be a clue as to what's going on with the naming today? While there's no clear answer, it's interesting to think about.

Cheryl told GQ magazine, ""I love kids, I'm obsessed with babies. I know that's what I was put on the earth to do – to be a mother…Of course I've thought about baby names a million times. I like Alfie for a little boy.""

However, Liam told Hits Radio, ""I like the name Taylor. Taylor's pretty neutral for a boy or a girl. That's what I'm going to call my first child if I had children.""

Hmmm…there's no telling when or if they will reveal the baby name when they have decided but we have a feeling they will come to an agreement. And we're so excited when they do. However, multiple outlets are reporting that this photo could be the last fans see of the child. Apparently, Liam and Cheryl turned down lots of offers to publicly debut their baby and have vowed to keep his privacy and protect him from the public eye.

While this seems like something they would do, ","1"

"Brad Pitt’s custody victory over Angelina Jolie
After a bitter two year battle, Brad Pitt has won custody for his six children with ex-wife Angelina Jolie, Life & Style reports.

Ex-flames Brad and Ange have been working together for the better part of 18 months to reach an agreement on the custody of their six children – Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne – and according to Life & Style, the former couple have managed to come to an agreement.

The publication’s report reveals Brad was left ‘devastated’ when Ange told him she had planned to take their children to London with her for five months while she filmed Maleficent 2.

‘Even though Brad knows Angelina has custody and he has visitation, he felt it was a major breach in their agreement,’ a family friend spilled to the publication. ‘He was livid.’

Life & Style claim Brad then waged a war on his ex-wife, and that he came out on top!

The friend tells, ‘To keep him from contesting her London move, she promised Brad that he can spend longer periods of time with the kids before and after the trip.’

‘When he found out he was getting more time with them, Brad cried tears of joy,’ the friend adds.

The Hollywood actor has since been spending much more time with his six children, something he considers a ‘major victory.’

Life & Style reveal the kids are ‘ecstatic’ to be spending more time with their dad.

Friends close to the pair also reveal that although the kids love Ange, they ‘always wanted to be with their Dad more.’

Getting sober and being in therapy has only made Brad’s bond with his children stronger, the publication adds.

"Blake Shelton Calls Meeting Gwen Stefani 'a Miracle' After 'Hitting Rock Bottom'
Blake Shelton is opening up about his relationship with Gwen Stefani.

The country star appears on Sunday's upcoming episode of Sunday TODAY With Willie Geist and gives insight into the start of his relationship with the pop princess.

""When I was going through my divorce and just hit rock bottom, just like anyone does when they go through something that devastating, it's a miracle that I met somebody that was going through the same exact thing that I was at the exact same moment in time,"" Shelton, 42, says.

Both Shelton and Stefani, 48, divorced their partners — Miranda Lambert and Gavin Rossdale respectively — in 2015, before confirming their relationship in November of that year. For that reason, many people, Shelton and Stefani included, assumed they would have a quick rebound relationship.

""I think if Gwen and I were being honest right now talking about this, I think in the back of our minds we both kind of thought this is a rebound deal,"" Shelton reveals. ""I mean, because we're both coming out of a pretty low spot in our lives and we're kind of clinging to each other to get through this.""

The couple is still going strong, though.

""Now here we are, going on three years later, and every day that goes by it just feels like a stronger bond between the two of us and it constantly feels like it's going to the next level,"" Shelton says. ""That's the only way I think either one of us could describe it if she was sitting right here.""

The musicians have been especially sweet the last couple of weeks. Stefani celebrated Shelton's birthday over the weekend with dinner at BOA Steakhouse in West Hollywood, California, and a cookout on Father's Day. On Tuesday, Stefani shared snaps from her time with Shelton in his home state of Oklahoma.

"OWN Rearranges the Deck Chairs; Malia Obama's Redacted Spring Break
This article is from the archive of our partner .

Welcome to the Smart Set: Oprah's OWN network axes one-fifth of staff, the coverage of Malia Obama's spring break trip to Mexico appeared and disappeared, and Gwyneth Paltrow insists she wrote her cookbook all by herself.

Oprah Winfrey's OWN cable network cut loose 30 staffers on Monday, roughly one-fifth of its workforce. In addition to the layoffs, the network also ""restructured its network operations in Los Angeles and New York,"" and added Neal Kirsch, a longtime Discovery executive, to upper management. He'll now serve as chief operating officer and chief financial officer at OWN and report to Sheri Salata and Erik Logan, who Oprah named as presidents during the last OWN reshuffling just eight months ago. Monday's news followed the announcement Friday that OWN had cancelled Rosie O'Donnell's The Rosie Show after six months, multiple format changes, and backstage drama between O'Donnell and her production team. When The Daily Beast asked a former Rosie Show staffer for an assessment of what it was like to work on the show, the unnamed staffer was blunt: ""It was a f------ hellhole."" [The Washington Post and The Daily Beast]

The AFP ran with a story Monday mentioning that Malia Obama was ""vacationing in Oaxaca, Mexico, along with a number of friends and 25 Secret Service agents."" Completely inoffensive, but also kind of tacit violation of the media- politician ""My kids have the right to a private life when they're doing things out in the public eye"" bargain. The story of Malia's spring break was promptly ""picked up by Yahoo, the Huffington Post, and the International Business Times, as well as UK publications like the Daily Mail and the Telegraph.""

"Are A-Listers Like Bradley Cooper Self Tanning?
With all the hype surrounding Hollywood’s recent awards shows, it appears the men of the red carpet have been the center of the A-Lister’s gossip ring.

And no- it’s not for looking handsome, or wearing that amazing Tom Ford tuxedo.

They’re actually taking some heat for self tanning!

When I read that, my jaw dropped.

I (along with millions of other women) thought the bronzed studs such as Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney and Bradley Cooper, looked great.

For some reason, there seems to be a stigma surrounding men using self and spray tanners.

Since when is self tanning only for women?

I know many men who want to maintain some color without damaging their skin, and I’m sure you do as well.

I for one, am more likely to notice a guy who has a nice tan going on, rather than one who is so white you can see his veins (although Edward Cullen may be the one exception).

When I see a man who is extremely pale, I think he looks sickly and that he spends too much time playing video games ;)

When a man has a a nice self tan (even if it’s just a little), he tends to look healthier, and it also shows he takes pride in his appearance.

Men should be encouraged to use self tanners, it’s a great alternative to tanning beds and/or laying in the sun (both which can lead to skin cancer and wrinkles).

There are also many self tanners out there that are specifically geared towards men. Big names such as Fake Bake and Anthony Logistics for Men have created tanners that cater to men!

Truth be told, both men and women can benefit from self tanning (not just Bradley Cooper).

By applying self tanner, you can automatically accentuate muscles, cover imperfections, smooth out your skin tone and even mask cellulite.

To me, it seems like a no-brainer to use one right before a national awards show. I’m sorry, but no male (or person) should get ridiculed for trying to better their appearance.

This goes for all you women out there as well.","1"

When asked about their relationship, a then 19-year-old Katie said, “I’m just going to say that I met somebody last year, I fell in love, I had my first love, and it was something so incredible and indescribable.” She added, “I feel so fortunate because he’s now one of my best friends. It’s weird, it’s almost like a Dawson-and-Joey type thing now.”

The pair broke things off before Katie went on to date Chris Klein for five years before marrying Tom in 2006. However, Katie and Joshua have always kept in touch despite other relationships. Surprisingly, she reached out to Joshua following her split from Tom in 2012.

“Like any old friend, it was like, ‘Oh, hi, how are ya? What’s going on?’; ‘I had a kid,'” Joshua told a Canadian talk show host about the phone call with Katie. “It was very nice, actually.”

So, does Jamie have a reason to be worried? That’s a tricky question, but Jamie is","1"
"Trump Rescinds Rules on Bathrooms for Transgender Students
WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, overruling his own education secretary and placing his administration firmly in the middle of the culture wars that many Republicans have tried to leave behind.

In a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice Department and the Education Department rejected the Obama administration’s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice.

That directive, they said, was improperly and arbitrarily devised, “without due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy.”

The question of how to address the “bathroom debate,” as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting Education Secretary Betsy DeVos against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation.","1"

Nick Grimshaw has revealed he found Angelina Jolie “cold” and Will Smith “fake nice” as he reflected on his six-year stint as host of the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show.

The 33-year-old will depart the role in September amid falling listening figures and will be replaced by Greg James.

Grimshaw will takeover Radio 1’s 4pm to 7pm drive-time slot vacated by James.

Speaking to The Sunday Times Magazine, the Manchester-born presenter spoke about the celebrities he has interviewed on the breakfast show and told how he thought Men In Black star Smith was “fake nice”.

He said: “He was high-fiving the receptionist and saying, ‘You’re the best receptionist ever.’ High-fiving the phone person and saying, ‘You’d better answer those phones!’ which I thought was a tad patronising.

“Coming into an office and saying, ‘Wow, you answer phones!’ It seemed a bit self-aware, like, ‘I’m really famous and you’re really excited that I’ve acknowledged you.’”

Grimshaw, who took over the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show from Chris Moyles in 2012, said American actress Jolie was “cold” but admitted he was surprised to like Kim Kardashian West because he found her reality TV show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, “a bit rubbish”.

He said: “She wasn’t trying to be nice, she was just a sweet, pretty girl; a bit airheady and taking pictures of herself, which is what she is selling. It isn’t an act.”

Grimshaw is the second-longest running breakfast show presenter in Radio 1’s history, ahead of Tony Blackburn and behind Moyles.","1"

"Eric Johnson Net Worth
What is Eric Johnson's Net Worth?

Eric Johnson is a retired American football player who has a net worth of $20 million. After playing college football at Yale University, Johnson spent seven seasons in the NFL with the San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints. Eric Johnson is better known for being married to actress/singer/entrepreneur Jessica Simpson. They were married from 2014 to 2025. They announced their separation after 10 years of marriage on January 14, 2025. At the time of their separation, Jessica Simpson's net worth was $200 million.

Johnson's football career began at Yale, where he excelled as a wide receiver and was named to the All-Ivy League team. The San Francisco 49ers selected him in the seventh round of the 2001 NFL Draft, where he transitioned to tight end. His best professional season came in 2004, when he caught 82 passes for 825 yards and two touchdowns. Injuries began to impact his career during his later years with the 49ers, and after a brief stint with the New Orleans Saints, he retired from professional football in 2008.

Relationship with Jessica Simpson

In May 2010, Johnson began dating Jessica Simpson, shortly after his divorce from his first wife, Keri. The couple's relationship quickly became a fixture in celebrity media coverage, with Johnson often appearing alongside Simpson at public events. They announced their engagement in November 2010, and Johnson became stepfather to Simpson's daughter from her previous marriage to Nick Lachey.

Family Life and Marriage

The couple welcomed their first child together, daughter Maxwell Drew, in May 2012, followed by son Ace Knute in June 2013. Johnson and Simpson married on July 5, 2014, in a lavish ceremony in Montecito, California. They later welcomed their third child together, daughter Birdie Mae, in March 2019. Throughout their marriage, Johnson was frequently praised by Simpson in interviews and social media posts for his dedication as a father and partner.","1"

This is one of the more interesting positional battles this offseason as the Browns went into camp with no less than four potential Week 1 starters. Recent comments from owner Jimmy Haslam indicate the team is highly likely to start one of their rookies at some point this season, but it currently looks as if Flacco has the inside track to start under center come the start of the regular season. Flacco has proven to be capable of sustaining fantasy production, both for himself and his pass-catchers, meaning fantasy managers will want to keep a close eye on the battle for quarterback in Cleveland as it unfolds.","1"

Kylie Jenner took to Twitter on Wednesday to refute a report that Kris Jenner has started guiding the careers of her rapper boyfriend Travis Scott and brother-in-law Kanye West.

The 20-year-old reality star tweeted: 'this isn't true' along with a link to an article by Complex based on a report by Page Six.

The 62-year-old momager is grandmother to both the rappers' children; Kanye shares North, four, Saint, two, and Chicago, two months with Kris's daughter Kim Kardashian, while Travis and Kris' youngest daughter Kylie welcomed baby Stormi also two months ago.

Not so fast: Soon after the report surfaced, however, Kylie tweeted that it was 'not true'

According to Page Six, the momager was behind West's parting with longtime manager Izvor 'Izzy' Zivkovic, as well as Scott's departure from Mark Gillespie.

'They've been off and on for years,' said a source told the site of West and Zivkovic.

'But Kris is in [West's]. Kanye's been making changes and [he and Zivkovic] have grown apart — but Kris definitely gives her opinion and Kanye's all ears.

"Kim Kardashian: Nude Cookbook on the Way?!?
Reading Time: 2 minutes

Not everyone is a fan of Kim Kardashian and/or the books she pretends to write.

Just the other day, some 74-year old got arrested after vandalizing six copies of Kim’s selfie-based memoir.

But we have a pretty strong feeling the only damage anyone will do to the tome discussed will be to spray one’s sticky seed all over its page.

If you know what we mean.

According to one of the funniest Radar Online stories we’ve read in awhile, Kardashian is considering the release of a nude cookbook.

Yes, a nude cookbook. As in, a cookbook that features family recipes AND photos of Kim Kardashian nude.

We challenge anyone out there to come up with a better idea that a book that will enable readers to feed both their actual appetite and their sexual appetite at the same time.

A video report on Radar claims that ""Kim Kardashian has found a new way to line her pockets, even when she doesn’t have any,"" adding by way of explanation:

""The reality tart is pitching publishers on the idea of a cookbook in which she poses nude next to her favorite recipes.""

This may seem like a far-fetched concept, but ask yourself two things:

Would you buy it? Has Kim ever shown any shyness when it comes to taking off her clothing?

You don’t need to tell us the answer to question number-one. We understand if you’re a bit embarrassed to admit it.

But the answer to question number-two is revealed below:

Before you dismiss this idea as pure nonsense, allow us to direct your attention to David Thorpe’s ""Rude Food.""

In that cookbook, the late photographer conjures images with subtle juxtapositions of attractive and tastefully nude models, along with an astonishing variety of foodstuffs.

Via Amazon, this allowed him ""to create the ultimate in humerous and safe innuendo.""

An anonymous insider tells Radar that Kardashian is convinced “her concept will succeed because she thinks she’s in the best shape of her life after having two","1"
"Beyonce & Jay-Z’s Reported Baby Gift For Kim & Kanye West Costs $23k – Hollywood Life
What does music’s most prominent power couple gift fashion’s most prominent power couple when a new baby arrives? Well, if you’re Beyonce, 36, and JAY-Z, 48, it’s a custom-made, diamond Lorraine Schwartz bracelet, worth a whooping $21,000, according to The Sun. That’s right, Kim Kardashian, 37, and Kanye West‘s third baby — who arrived on January 15 — is about to be the most decked out infant, well… ever. And, get this — Bey and JAY reportedly had the bracelet engraved with the number “3,” to signify Kimye’s third offspring.

“Beyonce and Jay could not be more pleased for them, they can’t wait to meet the little one, and have sent them this gift already,” a source told the outlet. “It shows they have all moved on from the past, and they are ‘familia’ once more.” Although all parties involved are reportedly thrilled about burying the hatchet, “Kanye is over the moon as he has always considered JAY Z his ‘big brother,’ and Beyonce has always been one of his closest friends.” Ironically, both power couples have three children each, and “it’s only a matter of time before the playdates begin,” the source added. Bey and JAY are parents to twins Sir and Rumi, who they welcomed in June 2016, and Blue Ivy, 6. Kim and Kanye are parents their daughter, North, 4, and son, Saint, 1, along with their new baby girl.

While this report indicates that JAY-Z and Kanye’s feud is over, JAY already hinted that he wanted to bury the hatchet during an interview with The New York Times back in November 2017. “But, that happens,” JAY admitted about there being tension with Ye’. JAY explained: “In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we’re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I’m saying?

"J-Rod! Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez on Love, Beauty, and Redemption
This, to Lopez, was a reveal. “The most impressive thing to me was how he did pick himself up and take that opportunity to make himself a better person,” she says. “The hardest times prove who you are. That’s what I love and admire the most about Alex. He doesn’t let anything beat him. He just comes back stronger.”

Each believes that if they had been single when they met, 12 years ago, the relationship wouldn’t have worked. “We had to grow and discover ourselves first,” she says. But it also works for another reason. As Goldsmith-Thomas says, “They weren’t afraid to dream, and they are still dreaming, both of them.”

The next night, Lopez is performing her smash show All I Have in Las Vegas. Onstage, she moves seamlessly from the best kind of sexy—with a sense of humor—to a festive Latin-inspired segment, to an utterly moving testimonial to her children, in which she sings Lee Ann Womack’s “I Hope You Dance.” She’s an incandescent performer, partly because, as Remini says, “there is nothing Jennifer does that she does half-assed. When she is in a project, she is in it, devouring it.”

“A-Rod’s in the house,” someone from the audience yells. She laughs. Yes, A-Rod is in the house. Although he’s seen the show many times, he’s still watching every detail. He nudges me, pointing out a middle-aged woman in a pink pantsuit dancing ecstatically to “Jenny from the Block.” Then he points out a gay couple in the front row practically swooning after one gets to touch Lopez’s feet. During a segment that’s all New York, with Lopez in a sequined baseball jersey, he nudges me again. “If you look closely, you’ll see what number she’s wearing on her jersey,” he says. It’s 13, his Yankee number.

He says, “We are very much twins.” She says, “I understand him in a way that I don’t think anyone else could.”

"The Scenes From Lifetime's 'Harry and Meghan' Movie That Probably Didn't Happen In Real Life
With less than a week until Prince Harry weds Meghan Markle, Lifetime adapted the couple's love story into a film aptly titled Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance.

Airing last night, the movie depicted the relationship timeline of Harry and Meghan—from the factual public moments and milestones to the probably less accurate (and more dramatic) behind-the-scenes love story. While the movie did include real life events from Meghan and Harry's relationship (including their first blind date and whisking away to Botswana), there were also some...ahem...harder-to-believe plot-lines thrown in as well.

Though the film's stars, Parisa Fitz-Henley [Meghan] and Murray Fraser [Harry], resembled their real-life counterparts pretty well, there were several scenes that you can bet almost certainly didn't occur—no matter how accurate the cast's resemblance was.

Below, we're breaking down the dramatic, very Lifetime-y moments of the movie that probably, absolutely, most definitely did not happen in real life.

1) Harry and Meghan almost got attacked by a lion in Africa.

On a trip to Botswana around the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana's death, the couple is dramatically confronted by an angry lion when they run outside in the middle of the night after a fight. The near-death experience, of course, causes them to make up immediately. Honestly, I can't believe this whole scene isn't already a Taylor Swift song.

2) Meghan tried to break up with Harry via FaceTime, only to have him surprise her on set of Suits at the SAME exact moment.

Okay, first of all, you honestly can't expect me to believe that this woman tried to break up with AN ACTUAL PRINCE via FaceTime. That's just not how this game works. On top of that, the moment she decides to end things with him is the same moment he's knocking on the door of her Suits trailer for a surprise visit to Toronto?

"Why did Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber break up?
Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have ended their relationship once again, at least temporarily.

Reports have surfaced suggesting that the pair, who reunited in 2017 after nearly five years apart that was plagued with reconciliation rumors, are taking some time for themselves.

On March 11, 2018, Us Weekly reported that multiple sources confirmed the news of their split.

Rumors are swirling about the reasons for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's recent breakup

In addition to various reports about Justin and Selena's breakup itself, a number of different theories about their reason for taking time apart have surfaced. None have been confirmed by either pop star, but that's done little to quell the chatter among their respective fan bases.

So why did Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez call it quits this time?

Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey

During their second go at love, countless outlets reported that Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, was less than thrilled that her daughter had decided to give supposedly-reformed bad boy Justin Bieber another chance.

Those theories have picked up steam in the wake of their alleged split.

A source told Us Weekly: 'It's been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications.'

However, People magazine's sources have refuted these claims.

'They have their own issues and are always on and off. She wouldn't base her relationship off what her mom thinks,' a source said.

It's not just Mandy that's not on board with the Biebs. According to Us, Selena Gomez's entire family had qualms about her and Justin Bieber getting back together.

Angelina Jolie is opening up about her difficult year, from a Bell's Palsy diagnosis to her split from Brad Pitt.

In a Vanity Fair cover story, Jolie reveals that in addition to high blood pressure, she developed Bell’s Palsy, a condition resulting from damage to facial nerves, which caused one side of her face to droop.

“Sometimes women in families put themselves last... until it manifests itself in their own health,"" Jolie, 42, said, credited acupuncture for a full recovery. Vanity Fair did not elaborate on the cause of the nerve damage.

Jolie, who underwent a hysterectomy in 2015 and a double mastectomy in 2013 after learning she carries a gene mutation that put her at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, also said she has been dealing with more gray hair and drier skin. ""I can’t tell if it’s menopause or if it’s just been the year I’ve had,"" she said.

The year in question is when ""things got bad,"" as Jolie terms it to Vanity Fair, with Brad Pitt, saying trouble began in the summer of 2016 when her upcoming film First They Killed My Father was in postproduction.

"Ben Affleck Was on a 'Bender' Before Jennifer Garner Took Him to Rehab, Source Says
Jennifer Garner was becoming increasingly worried about Ben Affleck before taking him to rehab for the third time, a source tells ET.

Garner drove her estranged husband to rehab last week and was photographed arriving at Affleck's house looking visibly upset outside of his Pacific Palisades, California, home. Later, the former couple, along with the actress' bodyguard, was seen driving away from Affleck's house with the Argo director sitting in the backseat, looking distressed.

“Jen was incredibly concerned because Ben was making excuses for missed plans and rarely answering his phone in the week before he entered rehab,"" our source says. ""She knows this pattern very well and became worried.”

According to the source, Garner eventually went to check on 46-year-old Affleck, and the actor appeared to have been on ""some type of bender.""

“She went over to check on him fearful of what she mind find, and sure enough found him with empty bottles strewn all over the house,"" the source says. ""He reeked of alcohol and clearly had been on some type of bender, and was in terrible shape.”

An eyewitness told ET last week that 46-year-old Garner looked ""distraught"" as she drove Affleck to rehab. The A-list stars share three children together -- 12-year-old daughter Violet, 9-year-old daughter Seraphina and 6-year-old son Samuel -- and were married for 10 years before splitting in 2015.

"Tom Selleck Weighs In on the ‘Magnum P.I.’ Reboot — And If He’ll Make a Cameo
Yes, Tom Selleck wishes the new Thomas Magnum well. No, he won’t have anything to do with it.

If you haven’t heard yet, CBS has ordered their Magnum P.I. reboot to series. If you’re a millennial who doesn’t pay attention to old stuff, that’s the loosey-goosey detective show starring the irresistibly charming Tom Selleck that ran on CBS from 1980-1988 and earned him a Best Actor Emmy.

Peter Lenkov, the redo specialist responsible for updating Hawaii Five-O and MacGyver is the guy in charge. He’s hired Jay Hernandez (The Expanse, Suicide Squad) to play Thomas Magnum, like his predecessor, a former Navy Seal turned private investigator who lives in Hawaii.

So what does Selleck, now happily playing NYPD commissioner Frank Reagan in Blue Bloods, another long-running series — it will beat Magnum’s length of service next season — have to say about the new version? He chose to share his feelings for the first time to TV Guide Magazine and TV Insider.

The actor says when he was in L.A. (he lives on a ranch north of the city when he’s not shooting Blue Bloods) he was asked to come to CBS’s West Coast HQ for a meeting with Lenkov and David Stapf, the CBS TV Studios president.

“CBS is kind of my home network,” says Selleck. “I’ve done The Young and the Restless and (most of) the Jesse Stone movies as well as Magnum and Blue Bloods with them.” They told him if he “had a problem” with the remake, their relationship was important enough that they wouldn’t do it. “Peter was very effusive about the project; he grew up with Magnum and this was his dream,” he adds.

Stapf suggested that he talk to Les Moonves, CBS Corporation’s CEO and Chairman of the Board. According to Selleck, Moonves talked about how, since Universal owned the show, they could “do whatever they want with it,” the actor recalls. “Les said, ‘We’d like to control the show We think we can do a better job.’”

"Shapeshifting
Ability to physically transform in mythology, folklore and speculative fiction

""Shapeshift"" redirects here. For the Swiss company, see ShapeShift ""Shapeshifter"" redirects here. For other uses, see Shapeshifter (disambiguation)

Zeus turning Lycaon into a wolf, engraving by Hendrik Goltzius

In mythology, folklore and speculative fiction, shapeshifting is the ability to physically transform oneself through unnatural means. The idea of shapeshifting is found in the oldest forms of totemism and shamanism, as well as the oldest existent literature and epic poems such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Iliad. The concept remains a common literary device in modern fantasy, children's literature and popular culture. Examples of shape-shifters include changelings, jinns, kitsunes, vampires, and werewolves, along with deities such as Loki and Vertumnus.

Folklore and mythology [ edit ]

1722 German woodcut of a werewolf transforming

Popular shapeshifting creatures in folklore are werewolves and vampires (mostly of European, Canadian, and Native American/early American origin), ichchhadhari naag (shape-shifting cobra) of India, shapeshifting fox spirits of East Asia such as the huli jing of China, the obake of Japan, the Navajo skin-walkers, and gods, goddesses and demons and demonesses such as the Norse Loki or the Greek Proteus. Shapeshifting to the form of a wolf is specifically known as lycanthropy, and creatures who undergo such change are called lycanthropes. It was also common for deities to transform mortals into animals and plants.

The prefix ""were-"" comes from the Old English word for ""man"".

While the popular idea of a shapeshifter is of a human being who turns into something else, there are numerous stories about animals that can transform themselves as well.[1]

Examples of shapeshifting in classical literature include many examples in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Circe's transforming of Odysseus's men to pigs in Homer's The Odyssey, and Apuleius's Lucius","1"
"Is Kathy Griffin’s Career Over? Top Crisis Managers Weigh In
The backlash surrounding comedian Kathy Griffin’s reviled photo shoot depicting her holding the severed head of President Trump hasn’t let down since it first exploded earlier this week.

In just the last few days she’s been dumped by CNN, Squatty Potty and several venues across the country. Even friend and “New Year’s Eve Live” sidekick Anderson Cooper was quick to distance himself from his former co-host, calling her photo “disgusting.” Now many are asking whether the comedian can survive her self-inflicted wound — one that’s increasingly threatening to derail her career.

“Being dropped by CNN definitely hurts her visibility,” Matt Hiltzik, a New York-based communications consultant whose clients have included Harvey Weinstein, Alec Baldwin and Justin Bieber, told TheWrap. “Her business will be fine. But her opportunities to grow beyond her core base will be limited.”

After widespread condemnation over her graphic photo, Griffin apologized on Tuesday, begging for forgiveness and acknowledging she “went too far.” But on Friday, she held an impromptu press conference with attorney Lisa Bloom, telling reporters she’s been bullied by Trump’s family while vowing to mock the president even more in the future.

But if the intent was to quash the flurry of negative headlines that have dominated the news cycle in recent days, it may have missed the mark.

“Kathy Griffin claims ‘conspiracy’ at mad, looping press conference,” proclaimed Salon. Jezebel called it a “poorly conceived mess.”

“I understand when you’re in this situation there’s a natural urge to respond,” public relations expert Howard Bragman told TheWrap, however, “that has to be done with great caution and consideration.”

Katy Perry has finally buried the hatchet with Calvin Harris after they fell out six years ago.

The pair fell out in 2011 when Harris was booked as the opening act for the singer’s tour but he pulled out at the last minute over issues with set production.

At the time Perry wrote: ”Calvin Harris will NOT be joining in on the fun and has CANCELLED last minute,” while Calvin hit back saying: ”Sorry to all who wanted to see me with Katy – her team suddenly moved the goalposts and I was to appear on stage with no production.”

However, Perry hit back, saying: ”The goalpost seems to be perfectly fine for New Young Pony Club, Yelle, Robyn, Marina & The Diamonds, to name a few. It’s fine, I’m used to you cancelling on me, it’s become ur staple! (sic).”

And Harris also dragged her into his public feud with Taylor Swift, after she started dating Tom Hiddleston and it was revealed that she had written the lyrics for his Rihanna collaboration ‘This Is What You Came For’.

He wrote at the time: ”I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do.

”I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it (sic).”

"Property Brothers' Drew Scott Is Engaged to Linda Phan
Sorry, ladies, Drew Scott is officially off the market!

The Property Brothers star proposed to longtime girlfriend Linda Phan at the Toronto restaurant Piano Piano, and PEOPLE can exclusively announce the pair are engaged.

“I’ve never met another woman like her and once you do, you want to be with her forever,” Scott, 38, tells PEOPLE of Phan, 31.

Scott has been planning the elaborate surprise for weeks, and was determined to keep his new fiancé off his trail as he coordinated every over-the-top moment. “I’ve had to be as stealthy as a ninja to pull this off,” he says. Scott even admitted he’s been carrying the ring around with him for weeks and has kept all planning offline so Phan couldn’t possibly come across any details accidentally.

The HGTV star, who has released two country singles with brother Jonathan, recently snuck off to New York City to record his own version of the Train song “Marry Me.” During tonight’s dinner, he arranged for the restaurant to play the track while he and Phan were having dinner, which cued the staff to bring out a cake decorated with illustrations from one of Phan’s favorite books, Dr. Seuss’s Oh the Places You’ll Go, tweaked to read “Oh the Places We’ll Go,” as a nod to their continuing journey together.

The festivities continued after dinner with a surprise engagement party at a nearby venue that Phan had been led to believe was a company holiday party. Friends and family, including both fiancés’ parents, as well as Scott siblings Jonathan and J.D., were all in attendance.

WATCH THIS: Ever Wonder Where the Property Brothers Live?

Scott and Phan met in 2010 at a Toronto Fashion Week event, and have been dating for six years. Phan serves as the Creative Director for Scott Brothers Entertainment, overseeing multiple projects including digital content, marketing campaigns and philanthropic effort for her new fiancé and his twin brother, Jonathan’s media company.

"Tess Ward dumped Harry Styles because she 'still has feelings for an ex', apparently
If you see people queueing around the block by Harry Styles's house today, it might be because the One Direction singer is in need of a shoulder to cry on following reports girlfriend Tess Ward ended their relationship.

We'll join the back of that queue, shall we?

According to The Sun, blogger and chef Tess called time on things with Harry earlier this week, citing still having feelings for her ex as the main reason.

Bear Grylls

""Harry and Tess haven’t seen each other for a number of weeks"", their source explained. ""They’re both constantly travelling the world. Tess [also] realised she still had feelings for her ex after splitting from him to date Harry and has apologised to him for her romance with the singer.

""It will take a while for Tess to build back his trust but they have been getting on as normal. She was in London this week and met her ex straight away — they’ve been inseparable since.""

The poor little lamb. Still, there's probably a jazzy shirt or a metallic pair of boots around that'll cheer him up, right?

Bear Grylls

The pair were first linked last month, when an insider revealed to The Sun that Harry and Tess were introduced my mutual friends, and he quickly became ""besotted"" with her.

""As soon as Harry met Tess there was an instant spark between them"", they explained. ""They really bonded over their mutual love of quirky fashion and food – and things turned romantic quickly.



""They've been on a number of dates while Harry has been in London and he's already introduced Tess to some of his close friends including his personal stylist Lou Teasdale.

""This really seems different to Harry's past relationships as Harry genuinely is besotted with Tess and doesn't want to risk messing this one up.""

"Rihanna: Boyfriend Hassan Jameel Warning Chris Brown to Stay Away?!
Reading Time: 3 minutes

Rihanna is … well, there’s no real way to communicate with mere words how amazing Rihanna is.

She’s beautiful, intelligent, talented, and just so many good things. There aren’t enough hours in the day to sit down and count all of her virtues.

(Getty)

She’s just the best, OK?

And if you’re a human being who walks this earth, then you surely know that.

It just makes sense that since Rihanna is such a treasure to us all, she’s even more special to the men she dates — and since last year, she’s been dating billionaire Hassan Jameel.

Hassan is the deputy president and vice chairman of his family’s company, which owns the rights to sell Toyota cars in Saudi Arabia.

We don’t know much more about him, since he and Rihanna have been keeping their relationship very private.

(Getty)

But we do know that they’ve been dating for close to a year now, and that they definitely seem serious about each other.

So that’s nice, right? It’s good to see Rihanna with someone who isn’t an aggressive, violent, hateful, scary douchebag.

And speaking of Chris Brown …

It seems like while Chris isn’t exactly an issue in Rihanna and Hassan’s relationship, Hassan is concerned about him.

A source tells Hollywood Life that ""He is uncomfortable with her ex Chris lurking in her past.""

(Getty)

Gee, wonder why?

""Hassan doesn’t trust Chris,"" the source adds, ""and he feels like he is unpredictable when it comes to Rihanna.""

""He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy. Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.""

His concerns may be valid — another source claims that even after all this time and even though Rihanna has clearly moved on, Chris is still hung up on her.

You would think the last thing Kourtney Kardashian needs right now is more guy drama — but that didn’t stop the pregnant reality star from stepping out with her former flame Justin Bieber!

In Touch previously reported that the eldest Kardashian sister, 37, is expecting her fourth baby, though it’s unclear whether or not the father is Scott Disick, 33, or boxer-model Younes Bendjima, 23.

The two were spotted at The Peppermint Club in Hollywood while LD accompanied Kourt’s sister Kim Kardashian, 36, on her trip to Dubai, where things allegedly went south thanks to Scott’s antics.

“Scott went completely MIA in Dubai and no one knew where he was at. He was supposed to be there to watch over Kim, but no one could find him,” a source told Radar Online. “Scott also told [Kourtney] that he is not Kim’s babysitter and that the reason no one could find him was because he had overslept — ten hours!”

And we thought he was behaving himself after rekindling his relationship with his baby mama last month.

We first saw Kourtney and Justin, 22, together in December 2015 at The Nice Guy before they enjoyed time together at a karaoke club. She was allegedly seen leaving one of the Biebs’ favorite hotels — the Montage Beverly Hills — at 4 a.m. the following morning.

Kourt’s ex — who is the father of her three children, Mason, 7, Penelope, 4, and Reign, 2, was said to be angry about their hookup, which seemed fine since Kourt “regretted” getting together with the pop star.

“She’s kind of beating herself up for ever getting involved with him in the first place, and not listening to her gut. She really regrets the whole thing,” a source previously told Hollywood Life.","1"
"Hugh Hefner's wife Crystal Harris 'will inherit nothing'

Hugh Hefner's wife Crystal Harris will inherit nothing after signing an ironclad prenup before their wedding and was never added to his will, it has been reported

Hugh Hefner's wife Crystal Harris will inherit nothing due to an ironclad prenup that means she was never added to his will, it has been reported.

The couple, who shared a 60 year age gap, tied the knot on New Year's Eve in 2012 at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles.

Before the nuptials, Harris was said to have signed an 'ironclad' prenuptial agreement.

A source told US Weekly that while the blonde beauty will be taken care of, she won't receive a penny of his fortune.

Instead, his estimated $43million estate, will be divided between his four children, the University of Southern California and a list of charities.

That number doesn't take into account the Playboy Mansion which was sold in 2016 for $100million.

The $43million figure was first revealed back in 2009 when Hefner divorced his second wife Kimberly Conrad.

At his peak, the Playboy magnate was worth upwards of $200million, but as the magazine's popularity tanked, Hefner lost millions.

By the time of his death the 91-year-old held 35 percent of the Playboy brand and still completely owned the magazine.

He had $36million worth of stocks and bonds and $6million in a joint account with an unnamed person.

His monthly earnings from the magazine only totaled $100,000, with the rest coming from his pension.

Hefner's body was driven away from his Playboy mansion early Thursday morning to begin the journey to his final resting place next to Marilyn Monroe.

The Playboy founder died of natural causes at the age of 91 on Wednesday night. Around 6.30am on Thursday, two hearses were seen leaving his Holmby Hills mansion.

Police lined the side of his driveway as the hearses left the residence to take the icon's body to an unknown location. He will eventually be buried in a Los A","1"
"'This is McCarthyism!': Trump accuses Obama of 'wire-tapping' his office before election
Donald Trump has accused Barack Obama of “wire tapping” his offices in New York City before the presidential election in November, claiming the former president had overseen a “Nixon/Watergate”-style intervention.

Launching a series of tweets at 5.35am eastern time on Saturday, the US president said: “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!”

He followed up that initial tweet with a string of others in the following 30 minutes which claimed Obama had defied a court’s rejection of a request to tap his office, and invited a “good lawyer” to make a case against the alleged operation.



Is it legal for a sitting President to be ""wire tapping"" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017

I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017

The president then compared the alleged surveillance of his communications to Watergate – the scandal in the early 1970s that brought down Republican president Richard Nixon after he ordered a break-in of the Democrat party’s Washington headquarters.

How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017

"Gwen Stefani: Dumped By Blake Shelton! Blindsided and Heartbroken!
Reading Time: 4 minutes

Just weeks ago, fans were wondering if and when Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton would have a baby.

Now, they’re wondering if the two will ever see each other again.

A grim report now says that Gwen and Blake have broken up.

The idea of Blake Shelton being the one to break up with Gwen sounds absurd, but that’s what InTouch Weekly‘s report says.

Even though she’s more famous and more successful outside of the Country music crowd, she fell for her The Voice costar.

Until recently, it had looked like he was just as crazy about her.

""Gwen doesn’t know what hit her,"" a source reveals. ""She’s heartbroken.""

Of course she is — Blake is only, what, her third serious relationship that she’s ever had in her life? This is a woman who loves with her whole heart.

""She continues to send him loving social media support from LA while he’s been out on the road.""

Which explains her continued social media posts about missing him while he’s on his tour.

""But Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her.""

The report goes on to claim Blake’s motives for breaking up with his better half, which really drives home the rumor that Blake is high on fame and money after his time on The Voice.

""Blake’s through with Gwen’s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women.""

Remember, it was rumored that Blake was cheating with Chloe Kohanski.

Of course she couldn’t resist People’s ""Sexiest Man Alive."" (I’m kidding)

""She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.""

After what Gwen went through with Gavin, that’s a very understandable fear. Especially since it was rumored that Blake cheated on Miranda just as much as she did on him.

Here is how the split allegedly went down.

Although having three beautiful children, North, four, Saint, two, and Chicago, three months, with his wife Kim Kardashian – the most famous woman on the planet – Kanye West is rarely seen smiling.

As Kim and Kanye shared their first photo as a family of five on Instagram on March 4, the couple were inundated with questions as to why they looked so unhappy, despite their gorgeous children in high spirits alongside them.

While North held a peace sign at the camera, the rest of her relatives wore blank expressions, something rapper Kanye is known for.

""Is Kanye ok?"" one person replied, while a second commented: ""Look at his face"".

Meanwhile a third added: ""It alright to smile...your kids are going to want to see pictures of you guys smiling. You all look miserable!""

""A smile from a happy parent won’t hurt,"" replied a fourth.

So why do the Kardashian-Wests rarely smile?

Kanye answered the question in 2015, drawing his inspiration from ""paintings in an old castle"".

He told High Snobiety: ""Back when I was working on Yeezus, I saw this book from the 1800s and it was velvet-covered with brass and everything.

"Is Chris Hemsworth breaking up the Ben Affleck-Matt Damon friendship? – Metro US
The Ben Affleck-Matt Damon bromance is being put to the test thanks to Chris Hemsworth.

The “Avengers” and “Thor” star has been trading barbs with Batfleck on social media over which superhero actor is truly Damon’s best friend. While there usually wouldn’t be any questions about the subject considering the Boston-bred stars’ long-standing friendship, Damon has been spending a lot of time with Hemsworth in recent months, especially since “The Martian” star made a cameo in last year’s “Thor: Ragnarok.”

Of course, gossip publications have noticed the budding new friendship as well, taking things a bit further by insinuating that Hemsworth is replacing Affleck as Damon’s BFF. Even though Damon has defended the “Justice League” actor’s odd back tattoo, that didn’t stop Affleck from taking to Twitter over the weekend to declare that Hemsworth can have Damon if he wants.

“Hey @chrishemsworth, you can have him! I’m Team @JimmyKimmel anyways,” Affleck tweeted, referencing Damon’s faux feud with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.

Hemsworth responded with the obligatory “Good Will Hunting” joke and said that Damon is probably just a bigger fan of Marvel movies than DC. The “Thor” star also tagged Kimmel in his tweet, so you know the comic had to weigh in on the bromance situation too.

Marc Anthony is an American actor, singer, entrepreneur, and producer who has a net worth of $80 million. Marc Anthony is the highest-selling salsa artist in history. To date, he has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. In 2023, ""Rolling Stone"" magazine ranked Anthony at #167 on its ""200 Greatest Singers of All Time"" list.

His mother, Guillermina, was a housewife, and his father, Felipe, was a hospital cafeteria worker and musician. Both of his parents were from Puerto Rico. Anthony grew up in East Harlem and was raised Roman Catholic. He is the youngest of eight children.

Marc began learning music from his father, who taught him how to sing in both Spanish and English. He is actually named after the Mexican singer Marco Antonio Muñiz.

He gained fame by performing a style of salsa that borrowed more heavily from African American and urban genres he listened to growing up.

In her Vogue piece, Dunham chronicled the hysterectomy process from start to finish, explaining that she made the decision in the hopes of ending her crippling endometriosis-related pain.

"What's up with Nicole Kidman?
Even by Hollywood standards, she has always been slender.

But, with her size six trousers hanging loose over her hips, and not even the hint of a curve where once there was a perfectly sculpted alabaster cleavage, it is clear that Nicole Kidman has lost a disturbing amount of weight.

Emerging from a yoga class in New York, the 36-year-old actress looked skinnier than she has ever been.

Associates say that, at 5ft 10in, she weighs only 8st 3lb.

Several friends are concerned that she is dieting and exercising more than is healthy, and others wonder what can be behind the change.

One old friend, who remarked after embracing her recently that she was nothing but skin and bone, was told with a wan smile: ""Perhaps I have been overdoing it a little.""

She certainly takes vigorous exercise.

Exercising more than is healthy

As well as her regular yoga classes near her rented penthouse in the SoHo district, she swims and jogs often.

Recently she was seen jogging in a tracksuit, hat and gloves in a temperature of 30c.

Although her defenders say they have seen her dining on sea bass, or tucking in to chocolate ice cream, there are allegedly times when she prefers vegetable smoothies to a meal.

Currently her body mass index - expressing weight in relation to height - stands at just 16.

The healthy range is 20 to 25, and doctors become concerned if it drops below 18.

She is, then, clinically underweight.

Because she is so tall, the loss of 15lb since her marriage to Tom Cruise ended two-and-a-half years ago is clearly apparent.

Her agents, however, talked last night about her being happy and healthy, and vigorously denied any suggestions of an eating disorder.

Catherine Olim, her spokesman, said: ""Nicole has always been slender. Look at American Vogue, she is glorious. I don't know what the fuss is about.""

Those protests are given credibility by a 40-page spread in the magazine she refers to, which hit newsstands this week.

"Kim Kardashian on Why She Won’t Have More Than Four Kids
Less than two months after Kim Kardashian welcomed her daughter Chicago, she already has baby No. 4 on her mind — but that’s where she would draw the line.

The singer and Michael Turchin became parents to twins in October 2021 — but the couple spent three years trying to start their family. The former ‘NSync member first told Us Weekly exclusively in March 2018 that he wanted […]

“I don’t think I could handle more than that,” the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 37, said in her cover story for Elle magazine’s April 2018 issue. “My time is spread really thin. And I think it’s important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.”

As Kardashian and Kanye West’s family blossoms (they are also the parents of daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2), so does their relationship. “He’s taught me to have more of an opinion,” she explained. “I’ve taught him to be a bit more calm or cautious. We’re a good balance.”

As Us Weekly exclusively revealed in July 2017, the couple hired a surrogate to carry Chicago because the reality star suffered from placenta accreta during her previous pregnancies.

Keeping Up With the Kardashians season 15 was a labor of love for the famous family. “It’s like nursery school — there are so many babies!” Kris Jenner, 62, tells Us Weekly exclusively in the new issue. The momager was of course referring to her nine grandchildren.

The Kardashian-Jenner crew grew quite a bit in last few months. Kim Kardashian welcomed her third child — a daughter named Chicago — on January 15. Then Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian became first-time moms (They have daughters Stormi, 5 months, and True, 3 months, respectively.)

Kris marvels at how Kylie has adjusted to parenthood. “Kylie is more calm than I was,” she tells Us. “I look at the way she she loves Stormi and takes care of her. She doesn’t go anywhere without her.” The businesswoman is equally in awe of Khloe — through she never doubted the Good American denim cofounder’s mothering skills.

"Kim Kardashian says Caitlyn Jenner lied about her father’s reasons for defending O.J. Simpson
Forget the Kardashian storm brewing around reports that different sisters are expecting babies in various ways. Another intriguing Kardashian storm brewing has to do with the reasons that the reality TV family is estranged from one-time parent Caitlyn Jenner

And the reasons have nothing to do with Caitlyn coming out as a transgender woman in 2015.

Kim Kardashian, along with her sisters Kourtney and Khloe, are fed up with “shady” claims Caitlyn made in her memoir about their father Robert Kardashian and his friendship with O.J. Simpson, according to Entertainment Tonight.

As Kim explains in the upcoming premiere of Season 14 of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” she’s upset that Caitlyn wrote that their attorney father knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of double murder but defended him anyway to get back at their mother Kris Jenner.

In her memoir “Secrets of My Life,” Caitlyn said Robert was jealous that Kris had moved on so quickly after their divorce by marrying the Olympic gold medalist then known as Bruce Jenner.

According to Caitlyn’s book, Robert knew it would upset Kris for him to join the defense team for Simpson in his trial on charges of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. That’s because Kris had been close friends with Nicole and knew that O.J. had been violent towards her.

In a clip for Sunday night’s “KUWTK,” Kim reads to Kourtney and Khloe excerpts from Caitlyn’s memoir.

"US report: Brad Pitt wins the kids
With the custody battle between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie raging on, the couple’s six children have ‘turned their backs on their mum’ and have chosen to live with dad, the National Enquirer reports.

According to the US publication’s sensational report, sources have claimed the Maleficent actress is ‘freaking out.’

‘The kids are fed up with their mum’s behaviour,’ says a source. ‘They want to move back in with their dad as soon as possible.’

‘The children can’t stand the drama,’ another friend dished to National Enquirer.

As previously reported, Maddox, 17, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12 and twins Knox and Vivienne, 10, were caught in the middle of an increasingly vicious war since their parents split two years ago, following a 12-year romance.

Although the actor has applied for regular visitation rights, Angelina has attempted to block him at every turn.

The Oscar-winning actress tried a series of tactics to smear Bard, most recently claiming he was a ‘deadbeat dad’ who hadn’t paid ‘meaningful child support.’

Even more recently, sources claimed Ange had ‘put spies on Brad’, and were instructed to follow his every move.

"Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and the search for the perfect PR Hollywood divorce
Celebrity marriages have not had the best of times: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale. Middle-aged, male A-list stars are taking a beating. The situation has become so dire that the celebrity news channel E! Online is predicting the “End of an era for celebrity idol worship”.

But nothing quite prepared the celebrity world for the totalling of Brangelina.

From alimony to palimony to the rise of the pay-as-you-go marriage (the wage-earning party to pay into a separation fund throughout the length of the marriage so there are no surprises when or if the marriage eventually ends), Hollywood couples have long been pioneers when it comes to marital innovation, but the end of Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie has left a nuclear pall over Hollywood-land.

The normally loquacious PR Howard Bragman, known for containing tabloid feeding frenzies, offered no advice. “Just sad to me,” he wrote in an email.

In some instances, say managers, both parties should be able to walk away with their careers and box-office potential enhanced. But the Brangelina marriage crack-up already looks to be heading in the opposite direction, with reports of the FBI looking into “an incident” on a flight the Pitt-Jolie family took on 14 September.

Pitt was reportedly “lawyering up” after the FBI announced the agency “is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued”.

“This one is going to end with both of them having their images bruised,” predicts Allison Hope Weiner, a lawyer and journalist who has covered Hollywood for more than 15 years.

What is clear is that in this confrontation nothing is left to chance and the leaks that appear in the media – usually via celebrity website TMZ’s host Harvey Levin, are deliberate and highly strategised.

"No Cinderella: Margo Jefferson on the real Meghan Markle
In February I saw a photo of Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge sitting next to each other at the Royal Foundation Forum, wearing colour coordinated dresses (lavender for Kate, deep purple-blue for Meghan). It wasn’t their dresses I minded, it was how they sat – legs crossed neatly at the ankle, knees pressed firmly together. It was that dulce et decorum pose passed down to generations of girls and young women expected to demonstrate their good breeding on social occasions – expected to show they are “ladies”. Both Kate and Meghan had folded their hands in their laps, the arms forming a gentle circle, the hands quietly clasped, as if ready to shelter a child or calm a kingdom’s cares. But it was the legs that haunted me – in part because I’d been taught that same bit of etiquette when I was a young black midwestern girl in the 1950s and early 60s, a child of the manners- and achievement-conscious black bourgeoisie, which in those days we called the Negro elite.

In fact, things turned out better than I’d feared. In a subsequent photo Kate crossed her legs at the knee. And when both women were asked in the video about the causes they planned to take up, Meghan spoke out. The words “MeToo” and “Time’sUp” flowed from her lips. So did the words “I fundamentally disagree”, as in: “What’s interesting is … when speaking about girls’ and women’s empowerment you’ll often hear people say: ‘Well, you’re helping women find their voices,’ and I fundamentally disagree with that. Women don’t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.”

"Meghan Markle's wedding dress is going on display — here's how to see it in person
The most famous wedding dress of 2018 is ready for its close-up.

Kensington Palace announced Wednesday that the Givenchy bateau-neckline wedding dress worn by Meghan Markle for her May 19 wedding to Prince Harry will go on public display at Windsor Castle later this year. The Royal Collection Trust’s A Royal Wedding: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex exhibit will also feature an identical version of the Household Cavalry frock-coat uniform worn by the groom on the couple’s big day.

The wedding outfits of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will go on display at Windsor Castle in 2018 and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh in 2019 in a special @RCT exhibition “A #RoyalWedding: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex”: https://t.co/j1N3WZFD50 pic.twitter.com/rKImNLva8w — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) August 29, 2018

When it comes to the Meghan’s dress, however, visitors to Windsor Castle — where the newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex wed — will see the actual dress designed for the royal bride by Givenchy’s Clare Waight Keller. Her embroidered veil and diamond-and-platinum tiara (a loaner from grandma-in-law Queen Elizabeth II) will also be on public display.

The exhibition gets underway on Oct. 28 and will run through Jan. 6, 2019. The wedding regalia will then move to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, Scotland, from June 14-Oct. 6, 2019.

"Malibu crash involving Bruce Jenner leaves 1 dead, 5 injured
Former Olympian Bruce Jenner was a driver in a multivehicle crash Saturday on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu that left one person dead and five injured, authorities said.

A two-mile stretch of the highway was closed for hours in both directions near Corral Canyon Road after the crash occurred shortly after noon.

The lanes were finally cleared and reopened shortly after 9 p.m.

Jenner, whose apparent transition from male to female has drawn intense media coverage in recent days, was being followed by paparazzi when the collision occurred, but it’s doubtful he was trying to outrun them, said L.A. County Sheriff’s Sgt. Philip Brooks.

Brooks described a chain reaction involving four cars:

A woman driving northbound in a Toyota Prius slowed down or stopped for reasons that were unclear. An elderly woman driving a Lexus sedan rear-ended the Prius.

Jenner, who was driving a black Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicle that was hauling a trailer carrying an off-road vehicle, then rear-ended the Lexus.

The impact propelled the Lexus into oncoming traffic, where a Hummer traveling southbound slammed into the Lexus. The driver of the Lexus, whom authorities declined to identify, died at the scene. Both the front and rear ends of the Lexus were severely damaged.

After the crash, a swelling crowd of onlookers and paparazzi led rescuers to call in reinforcements to manage the scene.

“It was a nightmare,” Brooks said.

Several guests at the nearby Malibu Beach RV Park walked down to the crash site and watched as authorities pulled the victim’s body from the mangled remains of the Lexus.

Photos on the celebrity gossip website TMZ showed Jenner, in sunglasses and a baseball cap, surveying the wreckage. Three photos showed the moment of impact when he rear-ended the Lexus.

"Madonna allowed to adopt four-year-old twin girls from Malawi who lost mother
Madonna has been granted permission to adopt four-year-old twins from Malawi, after she appeared in court to hear a judge rule in her favour.

The American pop star, who has already adopted two Malawian children and has a biological son and daughter, has seen her adoption request approved after attending court in person.

The children, previously reported to be twin girls named Stella and Esther, could leave Malawi with the singer shortly after spending the last two years in the Home of Hope in Mchinji.

Their father was in court to observe proceedings, while their mother is understood to have died a week after giving birth in 2012 from caesarian section complications.

The twins will join David and Mercy, the two children previously adopted into the US by Madonna amid some controversy.

Judiciary spokesman Mlenga Mvula has now confirmed that Madonna had been granted an adoption order by Justice Fiona Mwale.","1"

Back in 2021, Kate Hudson , now 44, and her fiancé, Danny Fujikawa, now 37, got engaged after 15 years of being friends, and four years of dating, per People . And while they haven't tied the knot just yet, they definitely seem to be enjoying a pretty blissful life together.

The couple welcomed a daughter together in 2018, Rani Rose, and after her arrival, Danny expressed his admiration for Kate in the sweetest way. “I’ve seen her do things that I can’t imagine doing myself and I’m very proud of her,” he told Entertainment Tonight.

“And I’m in awe of her for some of the things that she is able to do when she sets her mind to it,” he added.

Lucky for Kate, Danny makes her busy life brighter, even when they’re not on the best terms. ""He makes me feel beautiful every single moment of the day, even when we have fought,"" she said in a People cover story. ""I still feel loved. His devotion to the family unit makes me feel safe and confident and secure.""

“He gives me so much freedom…when you have someone who has such a deep trust in you and gives you so much freedom, it feels so nice,” she told Chelsea.

Kate, who has two sons from a previous relationship, in addition to her daughter with Danny, explained that they don’t have a ""traditional setup"" family- or relationship-wise.

"Irish actress Ruth Negga to see her Hollywood star status SOAR
She may not have won the Oscar, but there's shortage of blockbuster roles for actress Ruth Negga, who is next set to star alongside Hollywood A-lister Brad Pitt.

The Irish-Ethiopian beauty has reportedly signed on to feature in upcoming sci-fi adventure Ad Astra.

Today's top videos

The film tells the story of a man's journey across a lawless and unforgiving solar system to find his missing father, a scientist who poses a threat to all mankind.

The flick will be directed by James Grey and also rumoured to be lined-up for a part is silver screen is veteran Tommy Lee Jones. Details about and Pitt – also on board as a producer - and Negga’s role are being kept under wraps for now.

Last year Negga, 35, attracted international attention when she received an Academy Award nomination for her role in the historical drama Loving. Although she missed out on the Best Actress gong at the ceremony in February, she’s clearly not stuck for work.

IFTA winner Negga, who initially rose to fame on home shores in RTE’s Love/Hate and E4 series Misfits, is currently starring in season two of AMC's comic book adaptation Preacher. The actress appears opposite her other half, British boyfriend Dominic Cooper, 39, in the drama.

'It would be so lonely if he wasn't there,' she said about working with her leading man.

'People say, ""Never go out with an actor."" But if you were with someone with a normal job, and one of you had to go away, how would that work?'

The couple, who have been together since 2009, maintain a low-profile approach to their relationship.

However, last month in an interview with Net-a-Porter’s The Edit, Negga gave some insight into her romance with Cooper and spoke about the idea of having children. She revealed she is constantly thinking about 'when' and 'if' she would like children.

Negga said: 'By the time you're in a great relationship, it's like, oh, I'm 35. S***. So there is part of your thinking","1"
"Jennifer Aniston’s ‘tearful’ meeting with Justin Theroux’s ex
It’s hard to imagine Jennifer Aniston having a sit-down with Angelina Jolie — who Aniston’s then-husband Brad Pitt fell for while they filmed “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” together. But while Aniston may have played a similar role in the breakup of Justin Theroux and his girlfriend of 14 years, Aniston specifically requested a meeting to clear the air with her boyfriend’s ex, reports say.

According to Grazia magazine, Aniston had a “tearful” meeting with Theroux’s ex, stylist Heidi Bivens, at the Mercer Hotel last week. The two had a glass of wine as they spoke, sources say. Theroux was nowhere in sight.

“Jen has always been sympathetic to Heidi because she’s heard from Justin just how devastated she is about their break-up,” a source told the magazine. “Jen told Heidi that she understands what a painful time she has been going through and explained that she wanted her to know, hand on heart, that she would never steal another woman’s man.”

Aniston and Theroux met while filming “Wanderlust” in Georgia last fall, a comedy about a couple how moves to a rural commune when they find themselves unemployed. The two became close on set, but Theroux was still with Bivens at the time. Aniston and Theroux weren’t seen together again until March, when they both attended a dinner at the Chateau Marmont with friends.

But a week later, Bivens’ rep confirmed to Page Six that the couple had broken up. “She just moved out of their home last weekend,” the rep said. “She has no comment.” Sources said Bivens was “heartbroken” and “blindsided.”

"The Biggest Celebrity Feuds of 2017
There was no shortage of celebrity beefs in 2017.

Whether the fights were between co-stars or once close friends, the shade just kept coming. Let's take a look back at the most intense celebrity feuds of the year.

1. Blac Chyna vs. Rob Kardashian

Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian's split turned a new level of nasty when the former couple exchanged wild accusations against one another in a heated, NSFW social media war in June. Kardashian shared graphic naked photos of Chyna, accused her of cheating on him multiple times and also accused her of being on drugs. Meanwhile, Chyna took to Snapchat to accuse Kardashian of also cheating on her and being physically abusive.

One month later, a judge granted Chyna's request for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian.

""Revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,"" Chyna's attorney, Lisa Bloom, said during a press conference.

But the two now appear to be keeping it amicable when it comes to their daughter, 1-year-old Dream. In September, the two reached a custody agreement.

""Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully co-parent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,"" Bloom said in a statement.

Kardashian’s attorney, Robert Shapiro, also told ET at the time that ""Rob and Chyna are working together to put the best interest of their child first and have amicably resolved their personal matters.""

Of course, Chyna is still suing Kardashian, his mom Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian West over the cancellation of E!’s Rob & Chyna.

2. Dwayne Johnson vs. Tyrese Gibson

The drama between the Fast and Furious co-stars began in September, when Gibson left a comment on Johnson’s Instagram post, asking him not to let a rumored spinoff film starring Johnson’s character, Agent Hobbs, push back the planned release date of Fast 9.

What! Brad Pitt is crushing over a 21-year-old Angelina Jolie-lookalike!

According to a recent report by In Touch, the 53-year-old Hollywood actor is falling for 21-year-old actress Ella Purnell, who has portrayed the younger version of Angelina Jolie in Maleficent (2014).

Also read: Is there a squabble going on between Angelina Jolie's sons Maddox and Pax?

She was recently cast in the lead role of Starz's upcoming TV series ""Sweetbitter,"" which is being produced by Pitt. Hence, In Touch claimed that Pitt has been smitten by Purnell's performance in the movie so he cast her in his new series.

""He's so enchanted,"" the source told In Touch.

""Brad had Ella in mind from the get-go. He went out of his way to cast her,"" the source added. ""Ella is incredibly flattered by all the attention she's getting from Brad. She's told friends he's always been her No. 1 celebrity crush.""

The report also explained that Angelina Jolie is reportedly being furious about Brad falling for someone who is 32 years younger than him and ""her [Purnell] being cast in Sweetbitter.""

""She absolutely hates that Brad is cavorting with someone who played the teenage version of her in a film,"" the insider added.

""[Brad] realizes the huge age difference and that everyone would look at the relationship as a midlife crisis mistake,"" the source explained.

But according to the insider, Brad's attraction to Ella is more than just physical. ""He's taken with Ella's spunky, funny demeanour or and formidable acting skills.""

""It's only a matter of time before Brad takes their relationship to the next level,"" the source added.

Meanwhile, another website named Gossip Cop looked over the matter. The website, which is better known for rubbishing these kinds of rumours, claimed that this story is 'entirely fabricated.'

Cheryl has admitted that her statement announcing her split from Liam Payne was ""so cringeworthy,"" but that she and the One Direction singer ""don't hate each other"". Her candid comments came to light after Piers Morgan revealed the pair had texted each other, after Piers covered the break-up on Good Morning Britain earlier this month. On the show, he said: ""It's always weird when celebrity couples split up saying they have so much love for each other. If they love each other that much, why are they splitting up? They should be more honest and just say, 'We hate each other.'""

In his latest column for the Daily Mail's Event magazine, Piers revealed that Cheryl texted him after the broadcast to share her feelings. ""When we came off air, Cheryl texted me: 'I'm so sorry you didn't like my statement, Piers – perhaps I should have texted you the intimate details in chronological order as it unfolded,'"" the TV star revealed.

Cheryl and Liam's love story through the years:

Piers added that the pair had ""always got on well"" so he felt a ""sudden rare pang of guilt"" after making the comments. He apologised and Cheryl replied that she was ""only messing"". He continued: ""Fortunately, Cheryl quickly eased my concern: 'I'm just messing. I hate those kinds of statements too, so cringeworthy. But we don't hate each other. It just didn't work out.'""

"R. Kelly has received his second jail sentence for sex crimes. Here are all the sexual misconduct allegations against him.
is a senior correspondent on the Culture team for Vox, where since 2016 she has covered books, publishing, gender, celebrity analysis, and theater.

R. Kelly has been sentenced to 20 years in prison on child pornography charges. Kelly, one of the most celebrated R&B singers of the ’90s, was convicted in September 2022 on three counts of child pornography and three counts of enticing a minor in Illinois. He is already serving a 30-year prison sentence in New York after being convicted on sex trafficking charges in 2021. The two convictions are the culmination of a long, slow build of accusations that go back decades.

Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 25 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.)

That stasis began to change in 2018. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a 2018 BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes, and then again in Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly. From 2017 to 2019, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his publicist have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in 2017: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.”

"Kim Kardashian-Kanye West Divorce Rumors Proven False


Rumors of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West getting a divorce are highly exaggerated. The superstar couple are still married.

According to Gossip Cop, OK! Australia recently published an issue with the headline “Kim & Kanye: It’s Finally Over! Divorce Papers Signed!” The cover even showed documents, claiming they proved the divorce. But one never happened.

Videos by PopCulture.com

In fact, the documents on the cover are actually from Kardashian’s 2004 divorce from her first husband, Damon Thomas. They are in the public record, so the documents can be easily obtained on the web.

The content in the report is exactly the same as what appeared in In Touch Weekly.That issue included a supposed quote from Kardashian, “Kanye’s not the man I fell in love with.” The cover also claimed West broke down in tears and Kardashian took their three children to live with her mother, Kris Jenner.

At the time the two reports were published, both OK! Australia and In Touch were owned by the same company, Bauer Media. As of July 1, In Touch is owned by American Media Inc., the publisher of Us Weekly, Radar Online and the National Enquirer.

In Touch claimed that Kardashian was pushed “over the edge” after they went to Paris in June. A source told the magazine Kardashian was upset after seeing West hug Virgil Abloh at the Louis Vuitton fashion show. But if Kardashian was upset, she did not show it publicly. In fact, she retweeted a video of the scene, adding a heart emoji.

The trip was emotional for Kardashian, since it marked her first time in Paris since she was robbed there in October 2016.

The tabloid report also claims Kardashian told her family she was leaving West after his infamous remarks about slavery to TMZ and his tweets. In reality, Kardashian publicly supported her husband. Later, West did admit he thought Kardashian would leave him.

"Humiliation for Kris Jenner: Why toyboy Corey dumped her
Kris Jenner is on the prowl for another toyboy, after US Star magazine confirmed today that the Kardashian matriarch was dumped by boyfriend Corey Gamble.

Kris, 61, and 36-year-old Corey haven’t been seen together in public since Valentine’s Day – and even then they hardly looked loved up.

‘Corey was traipsing around behind Kris holding her handbag. It was like she barely registered he was there,’ says an eyewitness who spotted them out in LA.

In a blow to Kris’ ego, it’s believed that Corey, Justin Bieber’s former road manager, initiated their break-up.

‘She had been nagging him about a number of things for a while, including the fact that he wasn’t spending as much time with her as she’d like, and he just couldn’t take it anymore,’ says Star’s source, who adds that Kris is devastated.

‘She can’t stand to be alone. But I suspect she and Corey may have actually put on a united front in public for some time, since ratings have been way down for Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Kris is obsessed with maintaining the impression that everything is wonderful.

"Rihanna’s in, Wang is out: A preview of NY Fashion Week
NEW YORK (AP) — The French luxury house Longchamp will be there for the first time. So will Studio One Eighty Nine, the Ghana-based artisan initiative co-founded by actress Rosario Dawson. Look for Rihanna, but don’t look for Victoria Beckham or Alexander Wang.

There’s a never-ending churn to New York Fashion Week and its packed schedule of more than 200 September shows and other events is no different.

Here’s a rundown of who will be there, who won’t and other highlights:

RIHANNA’S A YES

The superstar’s size-inclusive Savage x Fenty line of lingerie, undies and intimate accessories will close eight days of fashion with an “immersive experience” the night of Sept. 12 in Brooklyn, because the fashion horde loves a good schlep to Brooklyn.

No matter. It’s Rihanna after all.

She debuted the line in May with sizes ranging up to size 44DD in bras and 3XL in apparel. The latest will be available for immediate purchase on SavageX.com. Pop-ups in New York, Minnesota’s Mall of America and elsewhere are planned.

NEW ARRIVALS

The family-owned Longchamp is having its cake and eating it, too, as the company marks 70 years in business with its first full-scale runway show in New York. It was a big American-themed year for the house with the opening of a Fifth Avenue flagship store, a collaboration with Shayne Oliver and Kendall Jenner as its new face.

Longchamp will also celebrate in Paris with a September event at the Opera Garnier, according to a company statement, as it has expanded in recent years from leather goods into ready-to-wear apparel.

“Longchamp has always acted on intuition — something we can allow ourselves to do because we are independent — and we chose New York as we are inspired by the energy and freedom of the city,” the company said.

Was Self Portrait similarly inspired as it landed on the New York schedule, or was it the London-based company’s higher profile due to one particularly famous fan,","1"

Sure, Kate Middleton Looks Great — But Let’s Talk About What Giving Birth Really Does To Women’s Bodies Play

Seven hours after giving birth to her third child in less than five years, Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, stood before the media — in heels and a cherry red Jenny Packham dress -- cradling her darling new prince.

The internet exploded. Some women pronounced the Duchess superhuman. Others offered blunt comparisons to their own postpartum conditions. Mercifully, most seemed to realize Kate’s seemingly supernatural ability to bounce back is not normal. But by focusing so much on her flawless appearance, we are distracted from the real trauma, physical and emotional, that is the childbirth experience.

I have three kids: twins the first time (one born vaginally, the second, four hours later, by Cesarean section) and a singleton (also by Cesarean section) after 16 hours of labor and two hours of unsuccessful pushing.

My pregnancies, apart from the unplanned C-sections, were normal and uneventful. And I went through all the things the vast majority of postpartum women experience (Kate too, probably): vaginal bleeding, uterine cramps, engorged breasts, raging hormones, soreness, exhaustion, constipation and the general condition of feeling as if you’ve been run over by a truck.

...a significant number of women, more than half by some counts, experience pelvic injury or dysfunction as a result of childbirth.

But we don’t like to talk about these things. And we definitely don’t like to talk about the longer term physical struggles many postpartum women endure: urinary and fecal incontinence, acute pelvic pain, back pain, muscle tears, hairline fractures, prolapsed bladder, pain during sex (if one can even summon the desire: low sex drive is another unpleasant side effect) and the “mummy tummy” (medically known as diastasis recti), what happens when a","1"

Johnny Depp: Disney bosses hated Jack Sparrow character... and asked if he was 'gay'



Angering the suits: Johnny Depp has told how Disney bosses 'couldn't stand his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow

Captain Jack Sparrow has quickly become one of the best loved characters in cinema history.

But the actor behind the eccentric pirate has revealed how Disney bosses initially hated his take on the character.

Johnny Depp revealed: 'They couldn’t stand him. They just couldn’t stand him.

'I think it was Michael Eisner, the head of Disney at the time, who was quoted as saying, ""He’s ruining the movie.""'

After working on so many independent, quirky films like Sleepy Hollow and Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, Depp's performance in the first Pirates film in 2003 brought him back to the mainstream.

But it appeared the actor decided to have a bit of fun with Disney executives, who were used to releasing clean-cut, family-friendly entertainment.



The 47-year-old, currently promoting new film The Tourist, says he wasn't bothered by who he calls 'Upper-echelon Disney-ites, going, ""What’s wrong with him? Is he, you know, like some kind of weird simpleton? Is he drunk? By the way, is he gay?""

'And so I actually told this woman who was the Disney-ite… ""But didn’t you know that all my characters are gay?"" Which really made her nervous.'

In the interview in Vanity Fair magazine, conducted by American singer Patti Smith, Depp also reveals how he was careful not to stand too close to his The Tourist co-star Angelina Jolie during filming in Venice, in case they gave the wrong impression.

In order to avoid speculation about an on-set affair, the actor says he went to great lengths, including 'having to hide, sometimes not even being able to talk to each other in public because someone will take a photograph and it will be misconstrued.'

The father-of-two says he was apprehensive about meeting J","1"
"Blake Shelton Says He Has a ""Stronger Bond"" With Gwen Stefani Every Day
Almost three years after they stepped out together as a couple, Blake Shelton is reflecting on his relationship with Gwen Stefani, saying the two share a bond that gets stronger every day.

Shelton divorced fellow country star Miranda Lambert in July 2015 after four years of marriage. Stefani filed for divorce from Gavin Rossdale, with whom she shares three sons, the following month. She and Shelton went public with their relationship that November.

""When I was going through my divorce, and just, hit rock bottom just like anybody does when they go through something that devastating, it's a miracle that I met somebody that was going through the same exact thing that I was at the exact same moment in time,"" Shelton said on the upcoming episode of NBC's Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist.

""And I think if Gwen and I were being honest right now, talking about this, I think in the back of our mind, that we both kind of thought, this is a rebound deal because we're both coming out of a low spot in our lives and we're kind of clinging to each other to get through this,"" Shelton continued. ""But now, here we are, going on three years later and every day that goes by, it just feels like a stronger bond between the two of us and it constantly feels like it's going to the next level. That's the only way I think either one of us would probably describe it, if she was sitting here.""","1"
"Why Prince Harry Didn't Get a Prenup Before Marrying Meghan Markle
Every item on this page was chosen by a Town & Country editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.

When members of the royal family tie the knot, there’s a lot at stake—including a whole lot of money. Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.

This is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.

“I don’t think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,” says Katie Nicholl, author of . “It’s commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.” Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen’s four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.

Yes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn’t be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. “You wouldn’t need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it’s not Harry’s,” says Duncan Larcombe, author of .

Larcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per","1"

From Alex Rodriguez's appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, it's apparent he is confident of two things regarding his relationship with Jennifer Lopez: the day they met is ""the luckiest day of (his) life"" and if you have her love, you better pick up the phone.

"Jennifer Garner – Gossip Cop
Jennifer Garner and Lindsay Shookus are not “both pregnant” with Ben Affleck’s babies, contrary to a new tabloid cover story. Garner and Affleck also have not “called off” their divorce. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust these untruths.

The latest cover of Star features photos of Garner and Shookus that were taken from side angles, giving the false illusion of protruding stomachs. These misleading pictures are being used to sell an entirely fabricated narrative about Affleck impregnating both women. It’s evident right in the sub-headline inside the issue that this is all bogus, with the magazine writing, “Sources Say Ben Affleck May Be Gearing Up For New Babies — With Both His Girlfriend And His Ex-Wife!” Garner is not Affleck’s “ex-wife,” as they are still legally married, and the use of the word “may” indicates the outlet doesn’t have any legitimate confirmation to back up its claims.

In fact, the publication goes on to contend Affleck “could be expecting a child not only with Lindsay — but also with Jen.” Notably, neither “may” nor “could” appear on the cover, where it’s declared Shookus and Garner are “both pregnant.” The tabloid lures readers in with what appears to be an announcement, but then changes course in the actual story, which is apparently about the possibility that they’re both carrying the actor’s babies. Following this bait-and-switch, a so-called “source” calls the situation a “mess,” but asserts “the initial shock is wearing off,” and Affleck is “actually feeling good about it.”

But how is it not known for sure then whether or not Garner and Shookus are expecting? The logic is faulty throughout the piece. It’s alleged that Affleck possibly impregnated Garner when he supposedly spent the night at her home back on March 7. “It’s no secret Ben was trying to woo Jen back, even while seeing Lindsay,” claims the tabloid’s untraceable “insider,” while the unnamed “source” theorizes Affleck and Garner “may have had a brief m","1"
"Justin Bieber’s tour cancellation: ‘I want to be sustainable’
Justin Bieber has explained to fans why he cancelled the remainder of his Purpose world tour, saying ""I want my mind heart and soul to be sustainable"".

After playing 150 concerts across 40 countries during the world tour, Bieber cancelled the final 14, saying he was ""just resting, getting some relaxation"". In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.

“I’ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,” he wrote. “Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.”

Perhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: ""Learning and growing hasn't always been easy but knowing I'm not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I'm not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes. I wanna be a man that learns from them and grows from them.!!""

He signed off by apologising for any grammatical errors: “I THINK THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IMPERFECTIONS!!”

With the tour now finished, the statement closes a chapter of his career. His album Purpose spawned a series of colossal hit singles, including What Do You Mean, Love Yourself, and Sorry, which until recently was the most streamed song of all time globally. It was replaced by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's Despacito, which Bieber also features on.

"The Biggest Celebrity Feuds of 2017
There was no shortage of celebrity beefs in 2017.

Whether the fights were between co-stars or once close friends, the shade just kept coming. Let's take a look back at the most intense celebrity feuds of the year.

1. Blac Chyna vs. Rob Kardashian

Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian's split turned a new level of nasty when the former couple exchanged wild accusations against one another in a heated, NSFW social media war in June. Kardashian shared graphic naked photos of Chyna, accused her of cheating on him multiple times and also accused her of being on drugs. Meanwhile, Chyna took to Snapchat to accuse Kardashian of also cheating on her and being physically abusive.

One month later, a judge granted Chyna's request for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian.

""Revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,"" Chyna's attorney, Lisa Bloom, said during a press conference.

But the two now appear to be keeping it amicable when it comes to their daughter, 1-year-old Dream. In September, the two reached a custody agreement.

""Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully co-parent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,"" Bloom said in a statement.

Kardashian’s attorney, Robert Shapiro, also told ET at the time that ""Rob and Chyna are working together to put the best interest of their child first and have amicably resolved their personal matters.""

Of course, Chyna is still suing Kardashian, his mom Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian West over the cancellation of E!’s Rob & Chyna.

"Should Angelina Jolie Be Concerned About Bulging Veins In Arms & Legs? — Surgeon Speaks
Angelina Jolie, 42, has seemed to have a thin figure with eye catching bulging veins on her arms and legs, but is it something she should keep an eye on? “The large vein on her forearm is the Accessory cephalic vein,” vascular surgeon, Dr. Larisse K Lee EXCLUSIVELY shared with HollywoodLife.com. “Angelina is a physically thin woman, so that’s why you’re seeing those veins protrude the way they are on her hands and arms. Being that she is a thinner build, when she flexes her muscles that’s when those veins are more pronounced and you can see them more. The vein that you’re seeing on her leg is the great saphenous vein. It starts at the groin and goes down to the ankle. I don’t see anything that would be pause for concern with Angelina.” Well, that’s definitely good news! See some photos of Angelina’s thin frame here.

Dr. Lee also shared what kind of veins would be dangerous. “If her veins were spider-like or if they were bigger bulging veins, then she would need to have those treated, but we typically only see that in larger people and older individuals,” she continued. “For what she is showing, it’s not symptomatic. She’s just a vascular woman.”

Angelina and her fit body recently made headlines when she graced the Nov. 2017 cover of Bazaar. The mother of six has been keeping busy since her split from Brad Pitt, 53, and keeps proving she’s dedicated to raising her children and staying active in her charitable contributions.

"Sister Wives Star Kody Brown Only Has a Relationship With Robyn
Things aren’t looking good for Kody Brown! When Season 11 of his reality show Sister Wives debuted in late 2016, “TLC was less than impressed by the ratings,” an insider revealed, explaining that premiere viewership of 1.8 million “was not enough” for the network. “So Kody told them he’d be willing to have the network slash his family’s pay from $180,000 for each adult to $180,000 total if it meant they could make Season 12. He put everything on the line to convince them it could still work.”

But, he couldn’t deliver and now his wives are turning on him. They’ve been struggling for the past few years, and Kody’s three “spiritual marriages” have all fizzled out. “His only real connection seems to be with [legal wife] Robyn now,” an insider revealed to Life & Style. “The other wives have all but given up on him. They mostly see him as an ex-husband who turns up to help with the children.”

But, Kody doesn’t want to accept that it’s all coming to an end. “He’s been blaming everyone for the current state of the show — except himself,” the insider admitted. “He’s too proud for that.” When the show began in 2010, viewers were fascinated to see a seemingly happy polygamous family on TV. But those days are over. “TLC has discovered you can only pretend things are all rosy for so long. Fans now realize the Browns are anything but a happy group.”

Meri has pulled away completely. She first shattered the illusion that all was well when she had an emotional online and phone affair in 2015 with a man, Sam Cooper, who turned out to be a female catfisher. “Kody has never forgiven Meri for it,” the insider said. She moved out of their Las Vegas culdesac months ago after purchasing a Utah bed-and-breakfast in late 2017 and rarely returns to Vegas except for family events or when TLC needs to film something with her there. “Kody’s happy with that arrangement.

American actor (born 1949)

Richard Tiffany Gere ( GEER;[1][2] born August 31, 1949) is an American actor. He began appearing in films in the 1970s, playing a supporting role in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and a starring role in Days of Heaven (1978).

"Victoria Beckham reportedly furious about David’s female friend
They’ve been married now for 18 years which, in showbiz speak, is pretty much a lifetime.

But according to a new totally unconfirmed report, Victoria Beckham has been growing increasingly frustrated with hubby David’s new female pal.

A so-called insider snitched to The Sun that Victoria, 43, is reportedly not a fan of David’s friend Lady Mary Charteris.

Read more: Duchess of Cambridge shows off her blossoming baby bump

Why, you ask? Well the source alleged it’s all because Lady Mary loves a good party and Victoria worries about that rubbing off on David, 42.

The insider said: “David has spent time partying with Mary at events into the early hours of the morning.”

Apparently David was introduced to Lady Mary through his good friend Dave Gardner, who is engaged to Hollywood actress Liv Tyler.

“Victoria is very worried that she is not the best influence on David,” continued the insider.

“They met at Glastonbury but Victoria is not fond of her.”

Oh dear. Of course, this is all just wild rumours and until Posh, Becks or Mary actually respond, we’ll take it with a pinch of salt!

And hey, even if Lady Mary does like a party, so what?

We all have that friend who loves a good night out and is buckets of fun to be around!

Lady Mary, 30, is rather well-connected (perhaps obvious given the whole title…)

She’s the daughter of Scottish nobleman James Charteris, the 13th Earl of Wemyss and 9th Earl of March and has Jerry Hall as her godmother.

The model and socialite has been married to rocker Robbie Furze since 2012.

'I got him a plate of prosciutto!' Animal lover Robert Pattinson reveals how his rescue dog became a pampered pooch overnight



There are many reasons to be a fan of Robert Pattinson, but just in case there are people who still need swaying, he has provided another.



The Twilight star showed how much of an animal lover he is during an interview on the Ellen DeGeneres which is set to air on Friday.



The 26-year-old chatted about his rescue dog Bear to host Ellen – who is also a huge supporter of animal rescue.

Animal lover: Robert Pattinson chatted about his rescue dog Bear when he and Taylor Lautner (L) were interviewed by Ellen DeGeneres

Robert revealed that he saved Bear, who was five weeks old at the time, from a kill shelter in Louisiana the day before he was about to be euthanized.



And Bear’s life changed in an instant as he went straight from the shelter and onto a private jet to Los Angeles – which Robert revealed is not his ‘way of usual travelling’.



Once he landed, Bear was tucking into some fancy meats that he was given by his doting new owner, and Robert joked that he had actually turned into a Hollywood diva dog by accident.

R-Pattz and Taylor Lautner, who was interviewed alongside him, laughed with Ellen about Bear’s unusually long tongue.

Ellen described the pooch as ‘like a Gene Simmons dog’ and Robert added: ‘It’s like a curtain.’

Robert admitted he thought that adorable Bear would keep on growing, but that never happened.

Harry Styles has a unique sense of style ... or does he? The singer-songwriter admits he has models his look after '90s country-pop superstar Shania Twain, who was one of his mom's favorite artists when he was growing up.

""I think both music and fashion, [my] main influence was probably Shania Twain. I think she's amazing,"" Styles raves to Entertainment Tonight.

It's a surprising connection, no doubt, but makes sense when you look at the former One Direction frontman and the country icon — both love colorful, extravagant outfits that defy the norm.

Styles has been putting his foot in the water of country music a lot recently, offering a stellar rendition of Little Big Town's ""Girl Crush"" during a show at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, where Cam was his opening act. He says the track is ""one of my favorite songs recently that's come out of this place,"" meaning Nashville.

He'll also take trailblazer Kacey Musgraves out on the road with him as an opening act during the U.S. dates of his 2018 Live on Tour. Additionally, the pop singer has said that he wants to collaborate with Chris Stapleton, citing himself as a ""massive fan."" He also has a fan in Gretchen Wilson, who praised his 2017 self-titled album, calling it ""something real.""

Twain's latest album, Now, her first studio album release since 2002's massively successful Up!, landed at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top Country Albums chart in 2017. The album's second single ""We Got Something They Don't"" is currently on country radio.","1"

"Are Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston getting back together?
In the wake of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s shocking separation, fans have just one question – is the Friends actress getting back together with Brad Pitt?

Hours after Aniston and Theroux announced their decision to part ways, Twitter was flooded with speculation about her next romantic move. Fans were quick to point out that the 49-year-old actress and Pitt are both single for the first time in years. Many shared hopes that the ex’s would find their way back to one another.

‘Somewhere, Jennifer Aniston is crafting her “Hey, let’s grab coffee and catch up” text to Brad Pitt,’ tweeter Madeline Hill wrote.

While a number of fans were excited at the prospect of Aniston and Pitt reigniting their old flame, some fans were grieving the end of her seemingly-perfect marriage to Theroux, 46. Others felt it was simply time to let any lingering Aniston-Pitt nostalgia go.

‘Please do not subject us to stories that Jennifer Aniston is getting back together with Brad Pitt. Everyone deserves a break while dealing with the end of a marriage,’ Twitter user Kristyn Burtt wrote.

Rumors are swirling about Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt potentially rekindling their romance

Some Twitter users were flat out opposed to the thought of a reunion, noting that Aniston has done well for herself since leaving Pitt in the past. The Allied actor, however, has been battling some demons.

‘Y’all really think Jennifer Aniston about to go sniffing around Brad Pitt when he got 10 kids and an alcohol addiction? Meanwhile she has a yoga body and a Smart Water deal w/ 0 kids in sight. She good,’ a Twitter user under the pseudonym C.Rush shared.

So is Jennifer Aniston getting back together with Brad Pitt?

Since Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux officially split last month, friends of Theroux have been telling the tabloids how happy Theroux is to be back to his “edgy” New York lifestyle. He’s been spending time with the “edgy” art crowd, which includes photographer Petra Collins. And now, he’s apparently hanging out with Aubrey Plaza. Is Plaza edgy? She must be.

The Daily Mail published several photos of Theroux and Plaza together this morning. The two were spotted walking around downtown on Sunday and going into Theroux’s West Village apartment. Plaza, 33, was wearing a Barbour jacket with a “March for Our Lives” sticker on the back, and Theroux, 46, was wearing a black Supreme hoodie with the words “illegal business controls America” on the back. He also had a Supreme sticker on his bike. You can see all of that here.

The Daily Mail points out that Theroux and Plaza have known each other for some time; Theroux appeared on an episode of Plaza’s show Parks and Recreation in 2012. But this is the first time they’ve ever been photographed together. What message do you think Theroux is trying to send here? (Besides “illegal business controls America.”)","1"

Caitlyn Jenner is planning to take it all off for a nude photo shoot, DailyMail.com can disclose.

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.

Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.

Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’

An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.

‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.

‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'

Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.

‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'

"Kim Kardashian Slams 'Liar' Caitlyn Jenner for Comments About Late Father Robert: 'She Is Not a Good Person'
A full season later, Caitlyn Jenner's memoir is still stirring up tension on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

In a sneak peek at Sunday's season 14 premiere, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian travel to Cleveland to visit Khloé Kardashian, who spends much of time there with her boyfriend, Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson — but they're interrupted by a news alert about Caitlyn's then-unreleased memoir, The Secrets of My Life.

""It says in Caitlyn's book Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty, but joined the defense team to get back at his re-married ex,"" reads Kim, 36. ""Robert told Caitlyn in secret after the O.J. murder trial that he believed his friend was guilty.""

""That's not true!"" interrupts Khloé, 33. ""Like, what?""

""Like, to sell a book, you're gonna make something up?"" says Kourtney, 37.

""Dad so believed in him,"" Kim says. ""It is so shady that Caitlyn came over and gave me the book, and then on the phone she said, 'Well, the final version has a few more things in it, but don't worry, it's nothing about you.' So she lied to me, because that is about me, if it's about our dad.""

""I have always had Caitlyn's back,"" she tells her sisters. ""But she is a liar. She is not a good person.""

""My relationship with Caitlyn was strained,"" Kim later admits in a confessional. ""I was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.""

"Fox knew of Bill O'Reilly harassment settlement before renewing contract
The parent company of Fox News says it knew about a settlement over sexual harassment allegations against Bill O'Reilly by an on-air analyst before the company extended the ex-host's $25 million contract in February.

In response to a New York Times story published Saturday, 21st Century Fox says it knew of the settlement but not the monetary amount. The Times reports O'Reilly reached a settlement worth $32 million with Lis Wiehl, a longtime Fox News legal analyst. CBS News has not confirmed the amount of the settlement. O'Reilly denied doing anything improper in an interview with the Times.

Wiehl accused O'Reilly of harassment and ""a nonconsensual sexual relationship,"" according to the Times, which cited unnamed sources briefed on the settlement. The paper reports Wiehl's attorneys sent a draft of a lawsuit to O'Reilly on Jan. 2, and the parties reached a settlement a few days later.

Fox News extended O'Reilly's contract six weeks later, boosting his pay from $18 million to $25 million.

""When the company renewed Bill O'Reilly's contract in February, it knew that a sexual harassment lawsuit had been threatened against him by Lis Wiehl, but was informed by Mr. O'Reilly that he had settled the matter personally, on financial terms that he and Ms. Wiehl had agreed were confidential and not disclosed to the company,"" 21 Century Fox said in a statement to CBS News on Saturday.

""His new contract, which was made at a time typical for renewals of multi-year talent contracts, added protections for the company specifically aimed at harassment, including that Mr. O'Reilly could be dismissed if the company was made aware of other allegations or if additional relevant information was obtained in a company investigation,"" the company said. ""The company subsequently acted based on the terms of this contract.""

"Miranda Kerr Goes Kiwi
Miranda Kerr was 18, just out of high school, a girl from the Australian countryside curious about what the rest of the world had to offer, when she first visited New Zealand. Along with a close friend from Gunnedah, the pastoral town where she grew up, Kerr set out to experience what for many is the draw of New Zealand: to escape and explore, to get a little lost and, in the process, get a little found. They slept in a tent. Swam in natural hot springs. Hiked terrain so raw and depopulated and expansive it felt as if they were the first humans to discover it. Kerr didn’t know it at the time, but her life would change significantly in the years that followed, thanks largely to her enviable genetic gifts: the long pale legs, the shimmering doe eyes and, most famously, the pert, dimpled cheeks that have made her one of the highest paid, most recognizable models in the world. Modeling, for Kerr, has been its own sort of adventure, one she will be the first to acknowledge as a stroke of good fortune not to be taken for granted. “Still, that backpacking trip, just having that freedom, was one of the best times in my life,” Kerr recently reflected. “Ever since, I’ve wanted to get back to New Zealand.”

For seven months, beginning last December, Kerr, 29, got her wish. She spent the majority of her nonworking time in Wellington, New Zealand’s capital, where her husband, Orlando Bloom, was filming “The Hobbit,” Peter Jackson’s two-part prequel to the epic “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, the films that first made Bloom a star a decade ago. Wellington — or “Wellywood,” as it’s been christened since Jackson set up his studio empire in the suburb of Miramar — is one of the most remote capitals on the planet: some 28 hours by plane from London, 23 from New York, 15 from Los Angeles, 14 hours from Hong Kong and Tokyo.

She's all mine! Ellen DeGeneres beams as wife Portia de Rossi shows off her svelte figure in black frock at premiere party



Ellen DeGeneres was so proud of Portia de Rossi and small wonder.

Portia was looking radiant from head to heels as she attended the Arrested Development season four premiere in Los Angeles on the arm of her talk show partner.

The slender 40-year-old was wearing a sleek-fitting, long-sleeved black brocade dress with sheer cut-a-way details on the sides and back.

Glamorous: Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi were arm in arm at the Arrested Development season four premiere in Los Angeles on Monday

The hemline stopped short of her knees to reveal shapely calves and slim ankles, and there were black pointed heels on her feet.

Portia wore her light blonde hair short and spiked on top, which added even more height to her five-foot-seven inches.

The former Ally McBeal star has always tended to be the girly one of the couple and proved that point again on this occasion.

Arresting: Portia, who stars on the comedy Arrested Development, wowed the crowd and Ellen in this clingy black number with sheer cut-a-way details on the sides and back

"Inside Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's Divorce on the One-Year Anniversary of Their Filing
Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are moving on with their lives a year after filing.

The duo filed to end their 10-year marriage on April 13, 2016, nearly two years after they originally announced their split. The divorce isn’t yet finalized but is progressing, sources have said, as the two have been in mediation with leading L.A. divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to settle privately.

Since then, they have continued to happily co-parent their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, and spent Easter weekend together with them in Hawaii, where Affleck has been shooting his new movie Triple Frontier.

“They’re doing well, and are both committed to providing a supportive environment for their kids,” a source close to Affleck tells PEOPLE. “They continue to remain cordial to one another. There is a lot of love and respect there.”

The day before the holiday, the whole family made a group trip to Sea Life Park in Oahu. “They made a family trip to interact with dolphins, sea lions and stingrays,” a source told PEOPLE. “They spent several hours at the park and looked like they had the best time. The kids were all very interested in learning about the animals. They all seem like huge dolphin fans.”

During the trip, Garner stayed at a resort while Affleck stayed at a nearby house. “Jen seemed excited about the trip. She hasn’t been to Hawaii for a while and always loved it,” added the source.

“The kids love when they all spend time together,” said a second source.

When filming breaks allow, the actor, 45, visits the kids at home in Los Angeles. “He’s found a really good routine,” an insider said. “He’s in a great place, enjoying his work on the new film and being able to fly back to spend time with the family during downtime.”

BRAD Pitt and renowned architect Neri Oxman have reportedly been dating for six months after a picture of the actor visiting the MIT professor's media lab emerged.

A student at MIT shared a picture of herself and friends with Brad inside the lab on November 28, but Neri wasn't in the shot.

The starstruck student captioned the picture: ""Ocean’s six? #whatjusthappened #bradpitt #medialab.""

A photograph of Brad and Neri is said to have been uploaded to social media around the same time but was soon deleted.

Brad is known for his interest in architecture, founding the Make It Right Foundation in 2007.

"Is Mariah Carey Forbidding Bryan Tanaka From Seeing Her Without Clothes And Makeup On? [Debunked]
Has Mariah Carey forbidden boyfriend Bryan Tanaka from seeing her without clothes or makeup on? That’s the sensational claim that’s been made in an article by Star Magazine. Apparently, Carey is so upset about her weight gain that she refuses to let Tanaka see her unless she’s fully clothed and made up.

But Gossip Cop , a site that’s well known for debunking celebrity rumors , is claiming that the story is nothing but fake news.

As Gossip Cop reports, Star Magazine has alleged that Mariah Carey gained 60 pounds during the summer and she has been hiding her body from her backup dancer-turned-boyfriend.

“Bryan has told Mariah that he loves her no matter what she weighs, but Mimi still won’t let him see her without clothes on,” their reported insider said.

The article goes on to say that Mariah has had special mirrors and lighting installed in her home which make her look thinner than she really is. She has reportedly done this because she thinks that making changes to her home would be easier than changing her body.

But Gossip Cop contacted Mariah’s press rep who has denied that these rumors are true. Mariah’s rep says that the story is a fabrication and “ridiculous.”

Mariah Carey is more than likely too busy working on new developments in her career to worry about rumors about her relationship with Bryan Tanaka.

As Billboard reports, Carey recently shared a trailer for All I Want For Christmas Is You, an animated movie based on her hit Christmas song. The story will revolve around a young Mariah who wants nothing more than to get a particular puppy for Christmas. Her uncle tells her that the only way she can get the puppy is if she takes care of his dog over the holidays which leads to a very adventurous Christmas.

"Hoda Kotb Says She Still 'Keeps in Touch' with Matt Lauer After His 'Today' Show Firing
Matt Lauer may no longer be a part of the Today show family, but he still stays in touch with his former colleagues on the morning news program.

“Yeah, we keep in touch with him,” Hoda Kotb, who replaced Lauer as co-anchor alongside Savannah Guthrie, told The Hollywood Reporter for its 35 Most Powerful People in New York Media 2018 issue.

Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC NewsWire/Getty

“I mean look, this is one of those complex situations,” admitted Kotb, 53, who received a congratulatory text from Lauer when she was named co-anchor in early January. “I’ve known him since I started working at NBC [in 1998]. When I was sick with breast cancer, he was the first to call. He helps and helped in ways that … you know, he was incredible in that way.”

Though Kotb has fond memories of Lauer, 60, she isn’t discounting the stories of the women who came forward and accused the previous NBC anchor of sexual misconduct.

“There is that Matt and then there’s the Matt that the accusers speak of. And those accusers’ voices matter and that story matters and it’s … (to Savannah Guthrie) It’s still tough, right?” Kotb said in the THR interview to Guthrie, who affirmed: “Yes.”

It’s been five months since Lauer parted ways with the show at the end of November after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.

“New Girl”show is suffering when co-stars Zooey & Jake’s feud on the set…Not having an affair then why such fight? Is it because of Zooey’s pregnancy mood swings?

Actors Zooey Deschanel and Jake Johnson are feuding on the sets of the TV series New Girl.

The show had to pay the price because of their fight.

Zooey and Jake’s quarrel gets heavy for the show

One of their co-stars says,

“can’t stand each other”

So Jake and Zooey are not on good terms with each other and because of their behavior, is affecting the drama series as well. Thus the TRP of the show is going low. The producers of the show are having a headache because of the actors.

The relationship between Jess and Nick also leads the show to suffer

In the finale of the fourth season of New Girl, there is a reunion between the characters of Jake Johnson and Zooey Deschanel. But the actors’ are not ready to patch up.

Sources say,

“I feel like they’re just good friends right now. I know a lot of fans want more, but personally I don’t think it’s in the cards right now. What I personally think, is that I really like the Nick and Jess dynamic together, but I think Season 3 it was just too much. I don’t think the show was ready for them to be together for an entire season.”

What reason for their feud?

The main reason for their fight is said to be Jake’s attitude after he got other roles. He makes her feel junior and inferior to her. He has starred in Jurassic World and Let’s Be Cops.

Moreover, he believes that he is superior to Jake and this attitude is causing the war between the starts,

“Her attitude is: This is my show, and Jake is just jealous. The tension is palpable on set, it’s amazing they hide it as well as they do.”

"Ryan Gosling Mourns Loss Of Beloved Dog While Promoting Bladerunner 2049
Eagle-eyed fans may have noticed that Ryan Gosling closed out his gig as host for the season 43 premiere of Saturday Night Live wearing a graphic shirt bearing the image of his dog, George. As it turns out, there was quite a sentimental reason before the sartorial statement. Appearing on Ellen yesterday, Gosling confirmed that the beloved canine had recently passed away at the age of seventeen. “He was a good friend to me,” Gosling told Ellen Degeneres during the sit-down. “There was something about George where he always—I think he felt being a dog was beneath him. He would not do tricks. if you wanted him to sit down you would have to convince him that it was in his best interest.”

Fans of the actor will be familiar with just how close the pair were—George even appeared alongside Gosling during an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a few years back. Gosling took Friday’s stint on Ellen to share some of his other favorite memories of the canine. “One time we were at an outdoor restaurant and he was sort of sitting on the pavement, looking forlorn down the street,” he shared. “Someone got up to go to the restroom, and I guess he’d had enough, and he got up on their seat and sat down at the table like a gentleman and looked around the table, like, ‘Yeah, that’s right.’”

In brighter Gosling news, his film Bladerunner 2049, for which he’s been on the promo circuit for over the past few weeks, opened in theaters on Friday after much anticipation to generally favorable reviews. The long overdue sequel is set to pull in $36 million in its opening weekend, and is already generating some early Academy Awards buzz—meaning that we can expect plenty more emotional talk show appearances in the coming months.

"Breathe review – Andrew Garfield fronts poignant biopic of wheelchair pioneer
Those impatient with high-end Britfilm period product might worry that this movie takes a rather picturesque view of disability issues, and for the first 20 minutes I came pretty close to this standpoint myself. But you have to give Breathe time to let its charm and its heartfelt decency grow on you. The film is about an important figure in the history of how we think about and respect disabled people – the wheelchair-use pioneer and polio survivor Robin Cavendish (whose son Jonathan is the movie’s producer).

Andy Serkis makes his debut as director, working from a robust screenplay by William Nicholson. Andrew Garfield plays Cavendish, a rather dashing fellow in the 1950s who zooms around the place in his sports car and plays a splendid game of cricket, hitting a six that breaks the teacups set out by the clubhouse and roguishly calling out: “Sorry!” He spots a beautiful young woman among the spectators: Diana Blacker, played by Claire Foy. It’s love at first sight, and marriage soon afterwards, and then a rather memsahib-like existence for her in Kenya (pronounced Keen-ya) because Cavendish is a “tea broker” there.

But then one day Cavendish feels faint and collapses: he has polio, is paralysed from the neck down, and after he is brought back to England, the medical establishment curtly tells Diana not to expect her husband to live any more than a few months, and only as a prostrate patient who must be passive and obedient. But armed with love and courage, the Cavendishes demand more of existence than this, and Robin defies the grumpy doctors by using a new respirator-wheelchair invented especially for him. It is possible that for this role, Garfield studied Kenneth More playing the disabled Air Force pilot Douglas Bader in the biopic Reach for the Sky.

It’s a valuable and touching story, and it is extraordinary to think that so recently, disabled people in this position were treated l","1"

The couple opened up for the first time about their relationship in an interview last month when Harry told the BBC that his late mother, Princess Diana, would have been “over the moon” about the pair’s engagement.

Harry and Markle first met for a drink in July 2016 on a blind date, brokered by a mutual friend, whose name they would not reveal, but “it was definitely a setup,” Markle said in the interview.

A second date was followed by a camping trip to Botswana. “Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me,” explained Harry.

“We were able to really have so much time just to connect,” added Markle, “and we never went longer than two weeks without seeing each other, even though we were obviously doing a long-distance relationship. We made it work.”

"Jennifer Aniston Reveals Struggles With Dyslexia, Anger; Shrugs Off Oscar Snub
This story first appeared in the Jan. 30 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

Just last week, all around Hollywood the words “Jennifer Aniston” and “Oscar nomination” were being mentioned in the same breath. The Friends star had made a stunning switch to serious drama with Cake, a roughly $7 million indie release that opens Jan. 23; the movie had debuted at the Toronto Film Festival to terrific reviews for the actress, if not for the film itself; she had Harvey Weinstein‘s former awards consultant, Lisa Taback, on the case; and a nomination looked teed up and ready to go.

Then on Thursday, Jan. 15, at 5:40 a.m., the rug was pulled out from under the movie. Hours after Aniston’s triumphant appearance at Cake‘s Los Angeles premiere, with a nomination from every other major voting body in Hollywood under her belt, a swirl of “SNUBBED!” headlines emerged when the best actress nominations were announced and they didn’t include the star. After Selma (which landed just two noms, for picture and song), the Aniston rebuke was the dominant entertainment story du jour.

“I know a lot of people were sorry,” she says, speaking the day after the nominations. “I feel I’ve gotten such wonderful love — I had almost more phone calls and flowers than I did for any other nomination [in the past].”

Whatever pain or anger she may have felt, whatever disappointment or sense of loss (and let’s not kid ourselves: Every Oscar snub feels acute to even the strongest person), Aniston never let on. She even joked about it a few days later on Ellen, calling herself “the number-one snubbed” (an honor that might perhaps belong to Selma director Ava DuVernay). She was exactly what millions of fans who have known her for two decades wanted her to be: funny and self-deprecating and exquisitely human.

Other actresses might have induced a tsunami of schadenfreude. But Aniston’s enduring appeal is rooted in the very f","1"
"Tom Cruise Dating In Disguise, Women Chosen By Scientology? Not Quite, Yet Holmes Is Queen Of Secret Romance
Tom Cruise has seemingly been all about his movie career since his high-profile marriage to Katie Holmes met its demise. The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors .

As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”

All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.

However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.

A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.

“Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”

It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop . Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.

Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic ","1"
"Is Your Town On The Rats And Roaches Infested And Infected Cities List Of America?
Based on the latest survey, perhaps the incoming Trump Administration can make these cities pest-free again.

Every year, lists of the top cities with the most rats and roaches infestation are compiled. While it’s good to be in the top 10 of lists for tourism and industry, city officials try to avoid having this particular distinction by any means necessary.

Based on current data, New Orleans, Louisiana tops the lists of cities with the most critters reported in households: Roaches, rats and mice.

Bloomberg compiled data from American households to get a reflection of what cities are plagued with infestations. Because the critters can’t talk — or won’t — government statisticians asked renters and homeowners for the data.

The science is not exact but is the best tool available to compile a list of cities with pest problems. The numbers and percentages are based on a person’s observation but don’t rule out or confirm exact numbers; some critters are very good at staying hidden.

Hey guys, look, New Orleans is #1 at something! #NOLAPRIDE https://t.co/ZK5aeHtxOg — Make Nola Better (@MakeNolaBetter) January 19, 2017

The reports typically come out every two years and are conducted by the American Housing Survey (or AHS). It targets the 25 largest metropolitan areas around the country (15 largest cities and 10 other towns). Officials ask probing questions about the means of financing the home and neighborhood safety, among other things, and if there is any evidence of cockroaches, mice, rats and other pests.

New Orleans, a port city with high humidity, is still recovering from the catastrophic damage brought on by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Not surprisingly, the Big Easy is finding it difficult to control its rampant pest problem.

"Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston might see each other at film festival


Pitt and Aniston at the Independent Spirit Awards on 3/22/03. Credit: Glenn Harris / PR Photos

Both Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have films out that premiere at the Toronto Film Festival later this month, and US is breathlessly reporting that the ex husband and wife might run into each other – gasp! Aniston , Pitt and his girlfriend Angelina Jolie were sort-of supposed to meet at a charity dinner they were all listed as co-hosting during the Oscars in February. Aniston went to the event for an hour, but Pitt and Jolie were no-shows, which wasn’t surprising as there were 10 other hosts listed and not all of them came to the event. Brad and Angelina went to the Independent Spirit Awards instead, where Angelina first showed off her pregnant belly in a tight black dress.

Now exes Brad and Jennifer, who split up in January, 2005 after four and a half years of marriage, might see each other again at this film festival. I’m sure they’ll be cordial to each other if they end up even speaking. Maybe someone behind the scenes will work to ensure they don’t cross paths though:

Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston could reunite at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival, when the exes are debuting their new flicks just two days apart. Pitt, 44, is among the stars who will walk the red carpet gala at the festival for the North American premiere of his Coen Brothers’ flick Burn After Reading on Sept. 5. (Pitt is also expected to attend the Venice Film Festival, where his film screens on August 27.) Meanwhile, Aniston, 39, is scheduled to attend the Toronto fest to promote her romantic comedy Management — about a traveling art saleswoman fighting off the advances of a flaky motel manager — which is premiering Sept. 7.

"Why Isn't Gwen Stefani Coaching 'The Voice' Season 13? She Could Come Back Before You Know It
The Voice features a rotating group of celebrity coaches mentoring up-and-coming talent. Gwen Stefani has played a big part in the show, coaching three seasons: Season 7, Season 9, and most recently Season 12. Her presence on The Voice extends beyond just coaching though. She's performed solo, mentored, and even did a duet with her boyfriend and fellow coach Blake Shelton. So, suffice to say, fans were surprised to hear she wouldn't be returning for Season 13, despite her popularity on the program. So, why isn't Gwen Stefani coaching The Voice Season 13? (Bustle reached out to NBC and Stefani's rep for comment, but has not yet received a response.)

This isn't Stefani's first time stepping away from her red spinning chair; she took a hiatus after Season 9, only to return for Season 12. At the time she took the break, Stefani told Extra she wanted to focus on her career. The Season 9-12 timeout had a clear purpose to it, she wanted to focus on making music and performing. Stefani's reasons for leaving this time are a little less defined, although the multi-night live show is a big commitment for already busy stars.

Minus Stefani, the coaches for Season 13 are Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson. And, for now, Stefani is keeping busy with music and performances. Stefani is releasing a Christmas duet with Shelton Oct. 6 and is promoting the jingle on her Instagram.

Stefani's love for Shelton is as strong as ever, even without The Voice, and she's been promoting his upcoming album on her social media. In February of 2017, Stefani went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and talked about their musical and romantic unity saying, ""It's so unbelievable ... I love Blake, he's just the most incredible guy. Like, everybody loves Blake ... he's just a sparkly, happy, amazing person.""

Fans believe Taylor Swift's single ""Look What You Made Me Do"" targets Kanye West. Larry Busacca/Getty Images The INSIDER Summary:

Kanye West fans are convinced Taylor Swift's album release date purposely coincides with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother's death.

In response to the date, Kanye fans took to the r/Kanye subreddit to plan ""Hey Mama"" day.

The plan is to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date in order to steal the potential top spot from Swift.

Around 2,200 fans have declared interest in the event so far.



Taylor Swift has done everything she can to rattle cages with her new single, ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" but not everything she's done so far has been welcomed with open arms. A big discovery was made shortly after she announced when her next album would be released — it coincided with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother passing away.

Though Swift was, well, swift to deny any intent to antagonize Kanye with the drop date, she has resorted to all sorts of petty moves in the past. Her discontent with Kanye runs deep, from award show embarrassments to his infamous, ""I made that b---h famous"" line on ""Famous,"" so she has the motivation to attack him and his family if she wants to.

The subreddit that started it all. Reddit

Not content to take Swift's denial at face value, Kanye fans have decided to strike back against the pop star, and they're planning their own event for Nov. 10. Allow me to introduce you to ""Hey Mama"" day, a concept dreamed up by some of Kanye's biggest fans on the r/Kanye subreddit. Here's a brief description of what they plan to accomplish.

"All Justin Bieber Wants Is to Get Back Together With Selena Gomez
The reality of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's break becoming a permanent breakup may be sinking in for the Biebs, or so People's new report suggests. A source close to Bieber told the outlet that despite all the Baskin Champion romance talk, Justin Bieber just wants to have Gomez back with him—at church, the ice rink, and beyond. “He loves her. He wants her back,” the source said, adding that Bieber “misses” Gomez.

Bieber and Gomez's last big public date was his father's wedding in Jamaica, where they recreated their 2011 wedding kiss. They spent 6 out of 7 consecutive days together that week, indicating they were stronger than ever and might make their on-off relationship permanently on this time, according to the tabloids.

But Gomez's family never approved of the Biebs, a major factor that led to their break, some outlets reported. And Bieber, according to Us Weekly's source, started acting selfish again, annoying Gomez. “[He] doesn’t care about anyone but himself,"" the source told Us on March 12. ""The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn’t need him.”

The break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber's March 1 birthday. Bieber never wanted this: ""Justin has been upset about the recent break from Selena and is trying to keep busy until they work things out,"" a source told E! on March 21. ""It wasn't his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now.""

Meanwhile, Gomez had a realization, E! reported on March 26: that he may be better, but they may still not be right... at least right now. ""Selena realized even though he's made some positive improvements, they just aren't a perfect match right now,"" a source told the outlet.

But Gomez's birthday post to Bieber remains on her Instagram, a sign that hope may not be lost yet.

But, it's not just Gigi who is concerned about the extreme anxiety. Zayn is also desperate to get better.

Chris Brown threatened violence against his ex-GF after they broke up, demanding she give back money and gifts he had given her during their relationship ... this according to Karrueche Tran's in-person testimony in court.

Karrueche took the stand Thursday in her restraining order case against Chris, telling a judge after she broke up with the singer ... he demanded diamond rings he bought for her to be returned. When she refused ... Karrueche says Chris became aggressive.

Karrueche explained that in text messages between herself and Chris post-breakup, he would say things like ""I'm not being nice to you no more, if I see you out in public again and I'm there I will make you hate me even more, don't be anywhere I'm out in public, I'm going to ban you from all events.""

"Brad Pitt Is Still Single, Despite Rumors He’s Dating MIT Professor Neri Oxman
Ever since he and Angelina Jolie announced their separation, Brad Pitt‘s love life has been a struggle to keep up with. That’s not due to any actual action on his own part; it’s wading through all of the rumors. One of those rumors was centered around his relationship with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Neri Oxman, which began in April. As it turns out, though, Pitt is allegedly still single and relishing that fact.

“He has gone on dates but he’s not looking to leap into a serious relationship at the moment,” a source close to Pitt told Entertainment Tonight. “He is content on his own and enjoys the quality time he spends with the children when he isn’t working.”

Instead of spending time on his love life, Pitt has apparently been putting all of his energy into parenting the six children he shares with Jolie, as well as his career, which includes a starring role in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. “He is focused on two of the most important things he should be focused on, and those are his children and his work,” the source said, adding that Pitt is “in a great place personally and professionally…. Being a father is his number one job, and he knows that. He will always be there for those children…. He’s spending more time out and about socializing with his close friends, but he also is still a homebody and appreciates hanging around his place.”

Pitt confirmed the latter in his latest revealing interview, with GQ, in which he talked about dealing with his loneliness. “You have to wrap your stuff up at night and bring order back to your chaos for the next day,” he said. “I find it a great opportunity for the introspection. Now you have to be real careful not to go too far that way and get cut off in that way. I’m really good at cutting myself off, and it’s been a problem.

Brad Pitt, accused of child abuse, is under investigation

A look at the Jolie-Pitt children Let's forget about the Brangelina divorce for a bit and talk about their six children.

Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services spokesman Armand Montiel told USA TODAY by law the agency cannot confirm or deny investigations.

But a source close to Pitt, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told USA TODAY that Pitt is taking this matter ""very seriously and is fully cooperating.""

""The claims are greatly exaggerated or fabricated,"" the source said. ""But he’ll always do whatever is best for his kids. Despite being on the receiving end of an onslaught of allegations, he remains focused on doing whatever is best for the children.”

TMZ reports the actor, whose wife Angelina Jolie filed for divorce Monday, is under investigation following an incident on a private jet.

TMZ says the case was referred over to the FBI on Thursday due to the fact that the alleged incident happened in the air while the family was on a plane from France last Wednesday.

“The FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,” FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY.

In divorce documents, Jolie listed the couple's date of separation as the following day, Sept. 15.

People.com reports that Pitt is accused of getting verbally abusive with one of couple's kids, as well as getting physical while the family was on their private plane. People and TMZ both note that Jolie and at least some of the couple's other children were present at the time. Pitt and Jolie have six children: Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 8.

The Los Angeles Police Department is so far not investigating. ""LAPD is not handling any report or allegations into child abuse against Brad Pitt,"" spokeswoman Officer Jenny Houser","1"
"Angelina Jolie Forced to Hand Over Kids to Brad Pitt Amid Custody Battle (EXCLUSIVE)
Angelina Jolie’s attempt at getting full custody of her and estranged husband Brad Pitt’s kids doesn’t appear to be working out the way she wanted.

Life & Style has exclusively learned that the actress must relinquish the pair’s six children to the 53-year-old for regular visits. “She has lost in the court of public opinion and will have to hand over the kids to him and stop playing games,” a source reveals.

The tables turned when Brad received a tremendous amount of support during his surprise appearance at the Golden Globes on Jan. 8. “It really sent a message about how people have seen him as acting responsibly during Angelina’s entire smear campaign against him. There’s no question Brad has won this battle,” the source tells Life & Style.

Brad in November at his first red carpet since the divorce announcement.

While the Allied star continues to soar, those in the 41-year-old humanitarian’s corner are starting to turn against her. “There are huge disagreements between members of her team. They are fighting. Some of them don’t like her campaign against Brad,” the source shares. One key individual in her camp even threatened to quit because she failed to recognize “that after the FBI and DCFS had cleared Brad, there just weren’t any grounds for her to get sole custody of the kids.”

As Life & Style previously reported, “There’s no evidence the kids are in any danger with Brad, so a judge has no reason to deny him joint custody. But there is simply no reasoning with Angie on the issue.”

"Why Selena Gomez Wasn't the Woman for Justin Bieber After All

They swore at the time they were just friends (""We have just stayed close and there's nothing more to it than that,"" she told E! News), but the attraction was growing. By the time a pal was characterizing their coupling as ""more than just a fling"" in early 2016, Bieber was reaching for the right words to define it as well.

You see, he'd learned a bit from his rollercoaster romance with Gomez. He wasn't going to recklessly dive into this union, hands in the air. Though he described the Drop the Mic host as ""someone I really love"" in his February 2016 GQ profile, he was careful not to label the connection they shared. ""I don't want to put anyone in a position where they feel like I'm only theirs, only to be hurt in the end,"" he shared. ""Right now in my life, I don't want to be held down by anything. I already have a lot that I have to commit to. A lot of responsibilities. I don't want to feel like the girl I love is an added responsibility.""

This wasn't about being free to party with groupies, he insisted, but rather a different, and dare we say more mature, way of approaching a relationship. ""I know that in the past I've hurt people and said things that I didn't mean to make them happy in the moment,"" he continued. ""So now I'm just more so looking at the future, making sure I'm not damaging them. What if Hailey ends up being the girl I'm gonna marry, right? If I rush into anything, if I damage her, then it's always gonna be damaged. It's really hard to fix wounds like that. It's so hard.… I just don't want to hurt her.""","1"

Chris Pratt has filed for divorce from Anna Faris.

The movie star cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split, according to documents obtained by E! News. Faris' response, which we've confirmed was filed simultaneously, reportedly mirrors her ex-husband's filing, according to TMZ.

Both are seeking joint custody of their 5-year-old son, Jack Pratt, and both have reserved the right to obtain spousal support.

A source tells E! News that everything between Chris and Anna is ""super amicable"" and that they're ""trying to do what's best for Jack.""

TMZ reports Chris and Anna noted July 13, 2017 as their date of separation, less than a month before the celebrity couple went public with news of the surprise split.

"Thomas Markle on Prince Harry, politics, and missing daughter Meghan's royal wedding
LONDON -- The father of the former Meghan Markle says he talked politics with Prince Harry over the phone -- and Harry said he should give President Donald Trump a chance. Thomas Markle told broadcaster ITV on Monday that he had several phone conversations with Harry, including one in which the prince asked for permission to marry his daughter.

Markle said Mr. Trump was discussed at least once: ""Our conversation was I was complaining about not liking Donald Trump, he said 'give Donald Trump a chance'. I sort of disagreed with that.""

Markle said he also asked his future son-in-law about Britain's 2016 decision to leave the European Union and got the impression Harry is comfortable with Brexit.

""I think he was open to the experiment,"" Markle said.

Harry's press office declined to comment on Markle's televised interview, which could raise eyebrows because senior royal figures are scrupulously careful not to comment publicly on domestic or international political affairs.

Markle, who had been scheduled to walk his daughter down the aisle, missed the royal wedding in May due to heart problems. He told ITV he was ""doing much better"" and that he regretted missing the big event.

The 73-year-old Markle, who watched the wedding from California, says he was ""very proud"" but that ""the unfortunate thing for me now is I'm a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle.""

""I can't think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles,"" he says of Prince Harry's own father, who walked Meghan most of the way down the aisle on her wedding day. ""He looked very handsome and my daughter looked beautiful with him. I was jealous, I wish I had been there, I wish it'd been me. But thank God he was there and thank him for that.""

He says the couple, now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will probably seek to have children soon.

"Kim Kardashian admits her selfie obsession is a bit ridiculous
Kim Kardashian has finally explained her selfie obsession, saying everyone needs to take it a little less seriously.

Covering the new issue of Adweek, Kim says she knows her constant picture-taking is a bit ""ridiculous,"" but it's just her way of remembering all the amazing things in her life. Which is fair enough, really.

""So many people think that taking so many selfies is just ridiculous,"" she says. ""For me, what's so funny is I love taking pictures and posting them on social media for memories.

""I'm kind of letting them know, yes, it is ridiculous, but it's all fun. I can look at a photo on social media and see a picture and know exactly where I was by the outfit I had on or who I was with. I take it more as a fun, emotional scrapbook that I love to look back on.""

In fact, Kim says she took her first selfie way back in 1984 when she was just five years old and, just like the rest of us, remembers the days when you had to lug an actual camera around with you.

"Camilla and Eugenie attack Kate and Meghan in shock public row
She may have been the picture of poise and elegance as she commenced her royal tour of Sweden and Norway alongside Prince William last week, but behind her smile, the Duchess of Cambridge had an altogether more worrying matter on her mind – her bitter rivalry with the Duchess of Cornwall.

Things are getting nasty behind the scenes at the palace, as Camilla has raised the stakes in her feud against Kate, 36, and Meghan Markle – teaming up with Princess Eugenie in a war of the weddings.

Things came to a head at a recent visit to St George’s Chapel, where both Meghan and the recently engaged Princess Eugenie are planning on holding their weddings later this year.

With Camilla in tow to help the 27-year-old go over plans for her wedding to Jack Brooksbank, the pair were horrified to bump into Kate and Meghan.

While Kate and Meghan were, of course, very police and lovely, Camilla, 70, took the opportunity to really make her feelings known, telling 36-year-old Meghan that she really disapproves of her wedding to Harry overshadowing Eugenie’s.

‘When they came face-to-face, Camilla really let Meghan have it. She told her she thought it was atrocious she and Harry were ruining Eugenie’s wedding plans – that Harry should have known that Eugenie had always wanted to marry at St George’s chapel,’ says the insider.

It was confirmed last week that Eugenie has been forced to delay her wedding with the princess originally hoping to tie the knot in September, but settling for October.

Camilla – who is reported to be jealous of Kate and Meghan’s rising popularity – has also been causing tension among the royals, with sources saying that one of the scheming duchess’ more brazen plots involved trying to convince Kate that Meghan was trying to steal some of her staff.

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are ’INFATUATED’ - says relationship expert
Meghan Markle kisses Prince Harry at polo match

Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Express.co.uk, Tracey Cox, a body language and relationships expert and TV presenter, claimed the Meghan and Harry are still getting to know each other two months after marriage. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were married on May 19 in a romantic ceremony at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle – less than two years after it is rumoured the pair met in the summer of 2016. Ms Cox told Express.co.uk: “They got married right in the middle of the honeymoon period when your brain is just flooded by love and sexual hormones and your judgement is completely skew. ""And now, anyone looking at them can tell they are absolutely smack bang in the middle, they are infatuated, they are at the lust stage, they are that wonderful stage everyone wants to stay at.""

When asked if the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's relationship differs from Prince William and Kate's, the expert suggested they could not be more contrasting. Ms Cox said: “Meghan and Harry they are still getting to know each other. “They are in the early, early, early stages.” “William and Kate have known each other since they were at university.”

LOVE BIRDS.....Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are still getting to know each other

She added: “You are looking at old love versus new love.” According to Ms Cox, the reason why Meghan and Harry's are still in their honeymoon stage is because of the secrecy they had to keep while dating. She said: “It is lasting so long for them because they haven’t seen each other that much. ""They hardly saw each other before and it was all in secret.""

Regarding the Royal baby and media speculation that Meghan might get pregnant this year, Ms Cox said ""not yet surely”. She added: “Let's give them two seconds without having to rush up the royal baby. “She has a long time, I don’t think so much pressure is on them as much as Willi","1"
"Justin Theroux looks far from glum about Jennifer Aniston split as he shows off guns on coffee date
Justin and his arms went on a coffee date (picture: film magic)

What breakup?

Justin Theroux looked to have been hitting the gym big time when he was spotted with a couple tickets to the gun show.

While we’re sure he wasn’t banking on being spotted, as he headed out with a companion on a coffee date last week in New York, there was no going incognito when you’re sporting biceps the size of the Big Apple.

One could say he’s simply living.his.best.life.

The Tropic Thunder star grinned and joked around as he walked his bike around the city with an aptly-described ‘mystery brunette’.

Justin strode alongside a pal (picture: The Mega Agency)

The 42-year-old could have worn a tidy turtleneck to disguise said guns, but instead he proudly showed them off in an Eazy-E tank.

Standard.

While there’s much speculation about the dating life of the producer and writer, following his split with wife Jennifer Aniston (and, of her’s too #equality), all eyes were on those bulging muscles as we all quickly scheduled a lunchtime yoga session, following by a weights class, just to try and emulate some sort of tone to mimic Justin’s.

Since his split from wife Jen – after the two got married in a secret ceremony in 2015 – Justin has also been linked to artist Petra Collins and actress Aubrey Plaza.

Maybe he’s just got a lot of friends, eh?

When it came to Aubrey, according to The Sun, the duo were just friends and the publication claimed that there was nothing romantic between them, after they were spotted returning to Justin’s apartment.

"Is Kim Kardashian Divorcing Kanye West? She's Considering Leaving Him
What was meant to be an emotional return to the city of love for Kim Kardashian, 35, who was held hostage and robbed at gunpoint there two years ago, was a trip that could potentially end her marriage. The reality star and her husband, Kanye West, flew to Paris to see designer Virgil Abloh’s debut Louis Vuitton fashion show, but Kanye had another outburst and it pushed Kim over the edge.

“Kim’s emotions were heightened,” a source tells In Touch. And apparently, Kanye wasn’t helping. After the show on June 21, Kanye “made a scene,” according to the source, when he leaped from his front-row seat into the arms of Virgil. “Kim didn’t know what to do,” the source explains, adding that the rapper burst into tears. “Kanye acting up just added to her anxiety.”

Kanye’s latest incident comes just a month after his controversial slavery comments and tweets about Donald Trump. Kim has apparently had enough of it, and told her family that she’s considering leaving her husband. “It’s over,” says one insider. “She’s realized he’s not the man she fell in love with.” But a divorce may be complicated for the couple, who have $300 million empires combined. “Kim wants her old life back,” the source says, but she’s too scared to fight with Kanye.

However, in a recent interview with The New York Times, the Ye artist admitted to thinking the future of his marriage was up in the air. He told the publication that he had a “real conversation” with his wife following the controversial appearance he gave on TMZ Live. “There was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, ‘Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?’” he said.

The actress was spotted arriving in New York last week, struggling to hide what looked like a pregnancy as she disembarked from a private aircraft.

Friends say she’s keen to avoid the spotlight and many suspect she was trying to hide the tell-tale bump as she jetted into the Big Apple for some rest and relaxation.

‘If Jen is pregnant, she is moving heaven and earth to hide it and keep the pregnancy under wraps,’ says a source close to the actress.

‘Right now, Jen is just committed to staying calm and healthy. She’s taken off on a holiday with a couple of close friends to get away from it all. She doesn’t want to run the risk of being spotted in LA, so she’s trying to stay out of the spotlight as much as she can.

‘It looks like this is the baby she’s always wanted.’

But sources say there’s another huge reason for her wanting to lie low – problems with Brad Pitt, who friends have confirmed would be the father of her child.

It’s believed Brad and Jen – who rekindled their fairytale romance after Jen’s marriage to Justin Theroux ended earlier this year – have been on the rocks in recent weeks because of Brad’s controversial relationship with Neri Oxman.

Last month reports surfaced that Brad had been caught getting cosy with the beautiful young architect, leaving Jen feeling insecure and concerned about their relationship.

Added to this is the fact Jen’s also under immense pressure during her bitter divorce from Justin Theroux, from whom she split in February, and it’s a difficult time for the actress.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are now the parents of a third baby, a girl, Kardashian announced on Twitter Tuesday.

""She's here!"" Kardashian declared in extra-large type on her Twitter account. ""We're so in love,"" she added.

Her tweet included a statement saying the baby was born via a surrogate on Monday at 12:47 a.m. and weighed 7 pounds, 6 ounces. She did not say where the baby was born, nor what she has been named.

""Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,"" the statement said. ""We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.""

She said the couple's two other children, North, 4, and Saint, 2, are ""thrilled to welcome their baby sister.""

Kardashian and West hired a surrogate because Kardashian's doctors strongly advised her not to go through a third pregnancy, as she discussed on her show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

She suffered from placenta accreta, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition that makes childbirth difficult because the placenta is attached too deeply to the uterine wall.

But she wanted a third baby and her desire grew stronger in the wake of her traumatic experience as the victim of an armed robbery in Paris in October 2016.

Did Taylor Swift's Kennedy obsession cause split? Conor 'freaked out as singer came on too strong'







Their summer romance lasted barely three months.

And now friends close to Taylor Swift and Conor Kennedy are blaming the split on the singer getting too serious too fast. Insiders says Taylor - who at 22 is four years older than Conor - freaked the 18-year-old by coming on too strong - and because of her apparent obsession with his famous family. Scroll down for video...



Summer romance over: Taylor Swift and Conor Kennedy have split after a three-month fling, pictured here in August in Massachusetts



'Conor's just an 18-year-old kid and wasn't ready for anything super serious,' a pal told RadarOnline.com.

'But Taylor is looking for her soulmate and it kind of freaked him out with how strong she came on,' the insider went on.

The friend also said that Taylor was obsessed with the Kennedy family - and was living out a fairytale with Conor.

'She was more obsessed with the idea of dating a Kennedy, than the actual Kennedy she was dating,' the pal added.

Earlier on Thursday Us Weekly reported the pair had split.

Although sources the website spoke to seemed to suggest their parting was rather more amicable.

Although for years the timing was never right, ‘Julia and Richard are undeniably drawn to each other and always have been,’ claims a source. So far that has always meant being in the friend zone.

The Hollywood pair are said to have reached out to each other in 2015 when they were both going through a tough time – Julia rumoured to have begun a trial separation with husband Danny Moder late last year.



‘They both were going through a rough time and poured their hearts out to each other,’ continues the insider, who notes that Richard was going through a messy divorce from second wife, actress Carey Lowell.



‘Their heart-to-hearts eventually led to discreet dinner dates in L.A, sometimes in private restaurant dining rooms, where they’d be left uninterrupted and could stay past closing hours.’

Set in the early 1950s at an amusement park on Coney Island, the film takes its title from the park's Ferris wheel. The story follows the second wife and the estranged daughter of a carousel operator as they both pursue affairs with a lifeguard.[4]

The film served as the closing night selection at the 55th New York Film Festival on October 14, 2017,[5] and was released on December 1, 2017, by Amazon Studios.[6] The film received mixed reviews, with criticism for Allen's screenplay, but widespread praise for Winslet's performance and Vittorio Storaro's cinematography.

Plot [ edit ]

Mickey Rubin, a Coney Island lifeguard who aspires to be a playwright like Eugene O'Neill, narrates through the fourth wall. Carolina, the daughter of Humpty Rannell, arrives at the boardwalk looking for Ginny Rannell, her father's second wife who works as a waitress at the clam shack. She begs Ginny to let her live with them, but Ginny leaves it up to Humpty, who angrily kicked her out when she married her mobster boyfriend Frank and threw away her college education and chance for a better life. Carolina tells him she is on the run from Frank, who she believes wants to kill her because she gave evidence of mob activity to the FBI. Humpty lets her stay on the condition that she save money to return to college and better her life. Ginny gets her a waitressing job where she works. Soon, Mobsters Angelo and Nick come around, asking Humpty and Ginny for Carolina, but they deny having seen her and the mobsters leave.

Ginny used to be an actress and was happily married, but her infidelity caused her husband to divorce her. She and Humpty are raising her young son Ritchie, a troubled boy who habitually gets into trouble by setting fires. She is unhappy with Humpty and life on the boardwal","1"

"What’s a ‘Covfefe’? Trump Tweet Unites a Bewildered Nation
WASHINGTON — And on the 132nd day, just after midnight, President Trump had at last delivered the nation to something approaching unity — in bewilderment, if nothing else.

The state of our union was … covfefe.

The trouble began, as it so often does, on Twitter, in the early minutes of Wednesday morning. Mr. Trump had something to say. Kind of.

“Despite the constant negative press covfefe,” the Twitter post began, at 12:06 a.m., from @realDonaldTrump, the irrepressible internal monologue of his presidency.

And that was that.

A minute passed. Then another. Then five.

"Meghan Markle Has Easier Ride With Prince Harry’s Royal Family Than Her Own Regarding Future?
Meghan Markle is constantly being compared to Kate Middleton, but this isn’t much different than when Kate first arrived on the royal scene and was compared to a famous princess. Kate was compared to Princess Diana, so comparisons among royal watchers are nothing new. Reports that Meghan Markle was having a hard time winning the queen’s acceptance first surfaced when Prince Harry’s new girlfriend was discovered by the media. Today, it doesn’t look like the friction is coming from the royal brood, but rather from one of her very own family members.

Meghan Markle did something refreshing and something a bit different than the usual royal protocol from decades past of keeping things under wraps. During a Vanity Fair interview, she had no qualms about making the revelation “We’re a couple. We’re in love” and offering up to the world just how happy she is with Harry, according to Fox News . She was so enthusiastic about her new love that the article was titled, “Meghan Markle, Wild About Harry.”

It has been seen in various reports on how the protocol that comes along with being royal dictates different aspects of a suitable spouse. In Meghan’s case, it was because she was previously married that the headlines suggested that the “Queen might not attend Prince Harry’s wedding,” like the one seen published in July from the U.K.’s Express.

Then there were the “jealousy” headline rumors suggesting that Kate was “jealous” of Meghan. One such article was seen back in March from Celeb Dirty Laundry. They claimed that Kate may be jealous of Meghan’s “sexy confidence” on the red carpet, which was a rumor going around at the time in the media. Meghan appears to be able to weather the rumors until they finally disappear from the headlines.

"Kate Middleton will never be jealous of Meghan Markle; here's why
Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle appear to have formed a close relationship, despite rumours of jealousy

The public has well and truly fallen in love with royal bride-to-be Meghan Markle. Which must, by default, mean that Kate Middleton is jealous of her rising star. Right?

Short answer: no.

But, if the public speculation is anything to go by, you’d be forgiven for thinking so.

The Hollywood Gossip recently ran an article titled ‘Kate Middleton: Jealous of Meghan Markle?‘ in which they claimed that the Duchess’ upcoming third baby and lack of involvement in the royal wedding could mean “potential for resentment”.

Similarly, the Daily Beast wrote, ‘Step Aside, Kate. Meghan Is the New People’s Princess’.

But it’s not just the media. Millions of Twitter fan accounts are dedicated to Meghan, many of which seem to be focused on tearing down Kate Middleton in their wake.

The reality of royal life is very different.

9Honey’s royal correspondent Victoria Arbiter says there’s no truth in the rumours that there’s tension between the two.

“It’s interesting isn’t it? Society loves to pit women against women… so clearly because Meghan is suddenly so popular Kate must be cowering in the corner feeling sorry for herself,” she said.

“But I simply don’t think that’s how Kate operates.

RELATED: The biggest pressure Meghan Markle will face as a royal (post continues)

“She’s been in the royal fold since 2011, she’s done an incredibly good job...and I think Kate is very content with her role. She loves being a mother.

“I think she’s quite happy to let Harry and Meghan have the limelight at the moment, because it is a lot when you’re front and centre all the time, when you’re dealing with the press intrusion, public intrusion. And of course, in this day and age, when everyone has a camera phone, you really can’t ever escape it.”

"Jon Hamm talks Jennifer Westfeldt split
Jon Hamm broke up with girlfriend of 18 years, actress Jennifer Westfeldt, nearly two years ago.

And on Friday the 46-year-old actor finally addressed the painful split in a new interview with InStyle magazine.

'It’s hard. It’s hard to be single after being together for a long time. It’s really hard. It sucks,' the Mad Men actor said.

Honesty: Jon Hamm broke up with girlfriend of 18 years, actress Jennifer Westfeldt, nearly two years ago; he spoke about the split to InStyle magazine

This comes after he was linked to Kate Beckinsale.

Hamm and the beauty were seen flirting at the screening of his new movie Baby Driver at the London Hotel in West Hollywood.

An onlooker told the New York Post newspaper's Page Six column: 'They were flirting and he kept going back to her all night. It was like he couldn't leave her.'

Strike a pose: On Friday the 46-year-old actor finally addressed the painful split in a new interview with InStyle magazine

Guns! He also showed off his muscles as he lifted his shirt while looking at plants

For the shoot, Hamm flexed his muscles while rocking denim; he also posed in neutral hues.

Also in the InStyle interview Hamm talked about the issues he has.

'I may be a narcissist in the way that most actors are, but I think it’s not to the detriment of those in my life. I try to be a good friend, a good partner, and all that stuff.'

Hamm added: 'I’m not perfect, and it hurts when you hurt other people. But the hope is to find the right balance so you can care about your own stuff enough to live your life and do your job well while also not being a monster.'

He then alluded to his rehab visit in February 2015.

"Why Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez's Friendship Is Stronger Than Ever
""The reason why she has been one of my best friends is because this person has never ever judged a single decision I've made. She's always met me where I've been. She's encouraged me when I've had nothing to be encouraged about. And I don't know if I would be as strong as I am if I didn't have you and your family because you changed my life.""

When Selena Gomez repeated those words in front of 60,000 people last year, it wasn't just a huge surprise for concertgoers experiencing Taylor Swift's reputation stadium tour.

Instead, it was a moment that instantly silenced the doubters and those left questioning where Selena and Taylor's friendship stands.

No, they don't post selfies together every week on Instagram. And no, they also aren't photographed visiting Hollywood hot spots month after month.

But for almost 14 years, these two pop music superstars have had each other's backs in a town filled with more than a few snakes.","1"
"Ben Affleck's History With Alcohol Addiction: A Timeline of the Actor's Struggles and Road to Recovery
Ben Affleck has returned to rehab as he continues to struggle with sobriety.

Jennifer Garner drove her estranged husband to an LA area facility on Wednesday afternoon, ET has learned. The 46-year-old actor knew he needed help and Garner was there for him, a source tells ET.

Affleck revealed in March 2017 that he had completed treatment for alcoholism in order to be ""the best father I can be,"" but his history with addiction goes back much further. In fact, his experience with alcoholism began as a child, watching his own father, Timothy, battle the disease.

Affleck has opened up about his past with alcoholism from his family's cycle of addiction to his 2001 rehab stint.



1986: Parents' Divorce

""To be honest with you, the marriage was so bad, and I remember feeling relief,"" Affleck told Barbara Walters in a 2012 interview, reflecting on his parents' divorce when he was just 12 years old.

""[My father] was an alcoholic... I did know that as a child. He drank a lot. My father was a -- what did they call him -- a real alcoholic. He, you know, drank all day, drank every day, and to his credit, he got sober ultimately,"" he revealed. ""He's been sober for several decades, which I think is pretty impressive.""

""[He] turned his life around in a very laudable way,"" the actor told The Daily Mail in 2008. ""But having such serious addiction issues has a major impact -- it colors who you are and becomes a part of you.""

Though he considered his childhood difficult, Affleck said it was his friend, Matt Damon, and brother, Casey, that helped him deal with his father's alcoholism and parent's divorce.

""I had good friends. I had Matt Damon, I had my brother, and I had a nucleus of friends that I grew up with and I had support from,"" he told Walters.

"The Russia investigation secret Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani know
CNN —

The biggest misconception surrounding the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that it will likely end in some sort of legal proceeding involving President Donald Trump. It won’t – for a bunch of reasons, the most important of which is that Robert Mueller, who is running the investigation, doesn’t seem to believe a sitting President can be indicted.

The much more likely outcome is that Mueller releases the findings from his investigation sometime this fall — and lets the chips, as they relate to Trump, fall where they may. Which means — and this is what Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have understood for months — that, ultimately, this isn’t a legal fight, it’s a public relations one.

Giuliani tipped his hand on that strategy Monday in an interview with CNN’s Alisyn Camerota. “I’ll be here with my version of the report and they’ll have their version of the report and the American people, in that sense, are going to decide it,” Giuliani said of the Mueller investigation.

“My version” vs. “their version.” What that construct from Giuliani misses, of course, is that one of the “versions” will be the result of a Justice Department-commissioned investigation led by the former head of the FBI that has already spanned more than a year. The other “version” will be Giuliani’s cable TV appearances and President Trump’s tweets.

That is, on its face, an apples-and-oranges comparison. But remember what Giuliani and Trump know: The debate over whether and how much Trump did wrong (if anything) is almost certain to be decided in the court of public opinion, not an actual court. And in the court of public opinion – particularly given the fealty that rank-and-file Republicans have shown (and continue to show) to Trump, the comparison is far more favorable to Trump’s side.

National Enquirer's grapevine claims that the actress is on the ""edge of a total collapse"" as she barely eats. ""There are times she feels light-headed and is on the verge of passing out,"" the insider claims.

The outlet's source adds that Jolie's ""food intake is mostly morsels of steamed veggies and fruit, very little protein, and water. She drinks wine and smokes cigarettes. The fear is she's headed for a physical meltdown.""

Although it is true that Jolie has been had some health issues in the past, Gossip Cop's sources debunk these claims to share that the National Enquirer's report is not true. Friends of the actress told the gossip site that there is no truth in the claims.

After it was long speculated that the Grammy-winning rapper had cheated on his wife Beyoncé with “Becky with the good hair” (according to her hit album Lemonade), Jay Z finally publicly admitted he had a roaming eye in November after the release of his album 4:44.

The LA Law star said that he and Lisa equally defend each other's honor.

'What do you expect you know in the long run? But every time I see it, I go, ""You go girl!'""

Even though he previously had his reservations about his wife coming on the show, Harry now admits Lisa is doing a good job.

Make-believe: TMZ has reported that Kim Richards invented the fact that she knows a secret about Harry that Lisa is covering up during last week's episode

'Well, you know, I am [proud] because she’s doing a magnificent job,' he said. 'I think she’s bringing some class to a show that is kind of a reflection of who we are today.

'So in some sense it is art in that respect. I think she’s doing an extraordinary job.'

As for the big secret Kim is accusing him of hiding? Harry said he is in the dark just like everyone else.

A photographer shouted 'Oi Bruce, get your d*** out' to Caitlyn Jenner as she left an LGBT awards show in London

A photographer shouted at Caitlyn Jenner 'Oi Bruce, get your d*** out' as she left the British LGBT Awards in London.

Police have launched a hate crime investigation after the incident on Friday night.

Jenner was a guest at the ceremony, where she received a Loud And Proud trophy following her transition from Bruce Jenner in 2015, which she has spoken about publicly.

As she left the event at the Grand Connaught Rooms in central London an onlooker hurled transphobic abuse at her until she got into a car.

It is also claimed that someone threw something at her while the vile comments were being made.

A source told The Sun Online: 'Caitlyn had an amazing night and when she won her award the room went crazy.

'She'd had such a wonderful time but as she went to leave the whole atmosphere changed.

'Someone shouted to her, ""Oi, Bruce, get your d*** out"". Then someone else threw something at her. It was horrible.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that officers had been called to the address on Friday night.

He said: 'Police were called on Friday May 12 at 11.40pm to an awards event in Great Queen Street, WC2, following an allegation of a hate crime.

'Officers attended and spoke to one of the organisers who alleged that a photographer had verbally abused a woman and a man as they were leaving the event.

The former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete made a documentary, I Am Cait, about her transition in 2015 with appearances from her loved ones including Kim Kardashian, who spoke about her admiration for Jenner's bravery

"Alex Rodriguez slams report he’s threatening to cut child support payments
Alex Rodriguez flatly denied a report that claimed he was threatening to cut child-support payments for his two daughters over a legal dispute with his ex-wife’s brother.

“I have always paid far more than the maximum in child support and that will never change,” the former New York Yankees star said in a statement to Page Six.

“It’s highly offensive to me that my former brother-in-law, who has been trying to pursue a frivolous case against me for four years and has gotten absolutely nowhere with it in court, is misrepresenting my relationship with my daughters to manipulate the public’s opinion,” he added.

The report Wednesday in the New York Daily News came soon after it was learned that A-Rod had just purchased a $15 million Manhattan apartment with girlfriend Jennifer Lopez.

According to the Daily News report, Rodriguez told his ex-wife Cynthia that he would cut his support payments for daughters Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, over a legal dispute with her brother, Constantine Scurtis.

A-Rod’s alleged threat was meant to send a message to Scurtis, the Daily News added.

Cynthia had texted her brother, explaining: “I’m just trying to defend my child support situation … and it’s terrible.”

She continued, “I have an email from (Rodriguez) telling me that he’s basically making me pay for not stopping you and telling you that I hate you.”

The tension Cynthia is referring to is a four-year legal battle between Rodriguez and her brother.

"Caitlyn Jenner Reportedly Thinks Kim & Kourtney Kardashian Are ‘Setting A Poor Example For Their Children’
Caitlyn Jenner allegedly isn’t too fond of the risqué photos her former stepdaughters Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian have been sharing across their social media pages in recent days. According to a new report, after the sisters bared their bodies in various nearly nude and bikini photos on Instagram, Jenner believes the twosome are “setting a poor example for their young children.”

At least that’s according to Hollywood Life , as the outlet alleged this week that an insider recently revealed that Caitlyn thinks the twosome’s photos are “in poor taste” and are “poorly timed” amid the important message being spread by the #MeToo movement right now.

A source alleged to the site that “Caitlyn feels Kim and Kourtney are sending the wrong message to their millions of followers” with their skin-baring pictures, as she’s supposedly been trying for years to get the twosome to cover up a little more while she was married to former wife Kris Jenner before their divorce in 2015.

“Caitlyn worries that the sisters’ inappropriate posts are setting a poor example for their young children,” said the source of the star, who reports are claiming could potentially join the cast of Dancing with the Stars Season 26 later this year.

Notably, both stars are moms to three young children. Kim and husband Kanye West are parents to 4-year-old North, 2-year-old Saint, and almost 2-week-old Chicago, while Kourtney is mom to 8-year-old Mason, 5-year-old Penelope, and 3-year-old Reign.

Jenner hasn’t yet confirmed the claims made by the outlet this week and hasn’t spoken publicly regarding her former stepdaughter’s risque snaps, though the site’s insider then added that Caitlyn allegedly “wishes both Kim and Kourtney would behave with more style and grace” after posting the provocative photos to their Instagram accounts, which have racked up millions of likes.

"Ben Affleck-Jennifer Garner split: Is the actress not ready to divorce the Batman star?
Looks like Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are not planning to put an end to their decision of parting ways, despite recent claims. It was recently reported Garner is not ready to divorce her estranged husband, but the reports were not based on actual facts or formal statements made by the representatives of the duo.

Affleck started dating Garner in 2004 and the couple was married the following year in a private ceremony. After celebrating a decade together, they both announced their separation on June 30, 2015. A recent cover of OK! Australia asserts that Jennifer Garner recently carried out a heartbreaking interview in which she revealed she is not ready to divorce the Batman actor.

The magazine talked about Garner's candid interview with CBS show, Sunday Morning. During the show, the mother of three talked about the difficulty she faced by the tabloid media after she announced her separation with Ben:

There was a solid decade where there was five or six cars minimum, and easily up to 15 or 20 on the weekends, outside of my house at all times. And looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I could cry talking about it.

Gossip Cop revealed that Garner never uttered the actual words during her CBS interview but somehow made the front cover of the OK! Furthermore, the magazine did not provide any grounds on which they added the quotes from the actress.

On the professional front, Ben Affleck recently signed onto the film adaptation of the critically acclaimed book The Last Thing He Wanted. The upcoming political thriller, which provides the backdrop of the Iran-Contra scandal, the Argo movie actor-director will share screen space with Anne Hathaway.

In addition to this, many are even wondering if the Academy award-winning actor will reprise his role of Batman in the upcoming Joker standalone movie featuring Jared Leto.

“Donald Trump finally got sick of James’s jokes and deported him back to England,” Styles quipped at the top of the show. Actually, Corden and his wife were at the hospital, and Styles shared some scoop about their new addition. “She looks a lot like James, mainly because James looks like a giant baby,” he joked.

Styles also addressed the kiss heard ’round the world: the one shared between him and Corden on Monday night’s holiday Carpool Karaoke. “I would like to take the opportunity to announce that we will also be having a baby,” he joked.

All jokes aside, Styles clearly has Corden’s back. So where did this adorable bromance begin? Billboard put together a timeline of their past Late Late Show shenanigans.

It’s about being discreet and being private and learning. That’s definitely a skill set. And being able to be mature and understand what the family is all about.

The business woman who is the brains behind her family’s reality show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, says that has no tolerance for,

When something needs to be protected and somebody else doesn’t understand the importance of that. That’s a problem.

Kris also makes it clear that she’ll take legal action against an employee that does something wrong and will hold them accountable.

We obviously will go to and spare [raises voice] no expense to hold somebody accountable if that happens on our team. I don’t care how much money somebody might have, if they have nothing. Some people think, ‘Oh, I don’t have any money, and they’re not going to sue me.’

She laughed,

Well, we’ll take payments. We’ll garner those wages for, you know, the next 10 years. But I just think that people don’t think. It’s a foolish thing to do. Some people think, ‘Oh, I don’t have any money, and they’re not going to sue me.’ Well, we’ll take payments.

While Brad might have been joking, a number of former nannies have spoken out about what it was like to look after the children.

One nanny had told In Touch magazine that the six children - Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, eight – were constantly fighting as children do.

They also made with wild allegations that Maddox – who was then nine – tasted drunk wine, and was able to drive a vehicle around one of the family's sizeable properties.

The nanny claimed that the children would quite often ignore bed time rules, as they said: “They have no control over the kids.

President Donald Trump kicked boyband One Direction out of one of his hotels after they refused to meet his grown up daughter, it has been revealed.

Band member Liam Payne let the news slip in a brand new interview with Rollacoaster.

Payne stated that Trump had phoned their room asking if they'd be happy to meet either Ivanka or Tiffany - which daughter remains unclear - and their manager declined after refusing to wake them up.

He said: “Trump actually kicked us out of his hotel once. You wouldn’t believe it. It was about (meeting) his daughter. He phoned up our manager and we were asleep.

Trump then proceeded to throw the entire band out of the hotel, and even refused to let them leave through a secret exit.

Payne continued: “He said ‘well, wake them up’ and I was like ‘no’ and then he wouldn’t let us use the underground garage. Obviously, in New York, we can’t really go outside. New York is ruthless for us. So he was like, ‘OK, then I don’t want you in my hotel.’ So we had to leave.”

One Direction are currently on an extended hiatus with each member currently enjoying solo careers; Payne's first record will be released later this year.

Speaking publicly for the first time since his abrupt firing, former FBI director James Comey told a Senate panel Thursday that he took President Trump's words as ""a direction"" to drop the investigation of ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn's ties to Russia. President Trump's attorney Marc Kasowitz will deliver comments at the National Press Club.

Comey confirmed Wednesday that President Trump requested his loyalty and later urged him to drop the investigation into ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, according to a preview of his opening statement. Comey describes one meeting at the White House in which he said Trump strongly defended Flynn, saying that his former national security adviser “hadn’t done anything wrong’’ in his prior contact with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go,’’ Comey said, quoting the president. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.’’

In recent months, however, the relationship between Jennifer and Brad reportedly has changed. Even though Aniston is now married to Justin Theroux , Jennifer allegedly just “can’t let go” of Pitt, and it’s rumored to be destroying her romance with Justin, as the Inquisitr reported. Now, Jennifer and Brad have gone from a platonic reunion to a rekindled romance, according to a new report.

Yahoo quoted an insider’s claim that Brad and Jennifer have “always been in love .” Recalling the era when Pitt and Aniston were Hollywood’s golden couple, the source said that Jennifer and Brad have continued to have feelings for each other despite her marriage to Justin Theroux and his marriage to Angelina Jolie.

“They were once the golden couple of Hollywood and apparently Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston still hold a soft spot in their hearts for one another.”

Quoting Woman’s Day magazine, Yahoo reported that Pitt and Aniston recently just happened to encounter each other in Los Angeles during Jennifer’s dinner date. Aniston was with friends at Soho House. During her meal, Brad showed up and joined the group, according to the insider.

According to The Mirror, Brooklyn had planned to spend four years studying photography at Parsons School of Design but after just one year, he’s made the tough decision to return home and find an internship in England, where his family now reside.

“It sounds as if he was truly homesick and was feeling lonely out there,” a source told the publication. “He adores his family, in the end it was the lure to come back to them all that swung it – and the prospect of a terrific internship.”

In October 2007, at the unpoliced border between truth and invention where most weekly celebrity magazines have their headquarters, a rumour began to take hold: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were splitting up. ""The romance is over,"" declared the US weekly In Touch, though its cover showed the world's most famous couple looking generally content. ""Jen blamed for wrecking marriage,"" Britain's Grazia explained a few weeks later, illustrating the story with a paparazzi shot of Pitt's ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston, wearing an irritated expression.

By then, though, In Touch already had a new scoop - ""A wedding to keep Brad!"" - and by the spring of 2008, things were looking official: ""Yes, they're getting married! The emotional moment Angelina knew she had to marry Brad."" (A special edition of In Touch soon followed: ""Brad and Angelina: the wedding of the century."")

Curiously, the happy news never made the cover of the US edition of OK!, which focused instead on ""the wedding of the year"" - a ""backyard ceremony"" between Aniston and the singer John Mayer. Within months, the Aniston-Mayer union had flowered into another OK! exclusive that seemed to put to rest, at last, the long-running drama of the then 39-year-old Aniston's hunger for motherhood. ""Baby time for Jen,"" the magazine announced. In the Jolie-Pitt household, by contrast, things were no longer rosy: in fact, the relationship was over. ""Brad walks away,"" revealed In Touch.

Of course, from a traditional perspective on the nature of reality, there were problems with these stories. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie had not separated, and did not get married. Jennifer Aniston and John Mayer did not get married either. As far as can be ascertained, Aniston is not pregnant.

Lopez, however, wasn't fazed. “They didn’t bother me at all. But I got a lot of flak for it from people in the industry. They’d say, ‘You should lose a few pounds,’ or ‘You should do this or do that.’ It finally got to the point that I was like, ‘This is who I am.

George Clooney NOT Begging Kit Harington To Hang Out, Despite Report

By Andrew Shuster | 2:07 pm, August 9, 2017

A new tabloid report claims George Clooney is begging Kit Harington to hang out with him but the “Game of Thrones” star keeps blowing off the actor’s requests. Gossip Cop, however, can exclusively debunk this bogus story.

According to the National Enquirer, Harington recently purchased a home near Clooney’s estate in England, and now Clooney is desperately trying to become friends with the TV star. A supposed “source” tells the magazine, “George has been pestering Kit with invites to his mansions in Berkshire and Lake Como – but he’s in for disappointment. Kit doesn’t want to be his new pal.”

The outlet’s dubious insider goes on to say Harington is trying to avoid the Hollywood scene, adding, “Kit’s mind is pretty made up. He doesn’t want to be George’s buddy, but George keeps begging him to come away on a motorbike tour. It’s getting annoying!” The seemingly phony source adds, “Kit’s home is too far to take a boat, thank goodness – or else George would probably row by.”

Of course, Clooney has a wife and newborn twins at home, so it seems very unlikely he’s looking to spend his free time with a young actor he doesn’t know. Regardless of how absurd the tabloid’s story sounds, Gossip Cop still checked in with a source close to the situation, who laughed off the report before assuring us it’s “false.” Unfortunately, the Enquirer has a habit of publishing phony reports about the movie star, so this latest piece of fiction comes as no surprise.

Gossip Cop recently called out the tabloid for making up a story about Clooney loving his wife Amal’s “pregnancy curves.” We also busted the outlet after it concocted a tall tale about Clooney’s baby boy peeing in his ","1"
"Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert Are Supporting Each Other Through Their Breakups




Following news that Miranda Lambert ended things with her beau Anderson East, the country music cutie found an unlikely source of support — her ex-husband, Blake Shelton. And the timing could not be better — as Blake is going through his own breakup from his now-ex, Gwen Stefani.

“Miranda reached out to Blake via text,” a source close to the former spouses tells In Touch exclusively. “Ultimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships. They’ve become close friends and allies over the past month or so.”

It’s a future that no one could’ve imagined for the exes, who were married for five years before calling it quits in 2015. At that time, it seemed unlikely that the two would ever reconcile, but now that the time has been able to pass, the two have become each other’s closest allies — and those closest to them say even a romantic reunion isn’t totally out of the question. “They have developed into close confidantes and are sharing intimate details of their lives,” the source adds exclusively.

It turns out the timing for their reunion could not have been more perfect. Anderson decided to call it quits with Miranda after spending nearly three years together. Elsewhere in Hollywood, Blake decided to cool things off with Gwen after growing more and more tired of her constant “drama” and their disagreements when it came to starting a family together.

And despite both women having the plug pulled on their relationships, they couldn’t be handling it more differently. While Miranda is left qusetioning what the future of her love life will look like, she refuses to dwell on the past. “Her allegiance is to her songs, the road, and her fans right now,” another insider says of Miranda. Gwen is taking the news as well as Miranda. “She continues to send [Blake] loving social media support from LA while he’s been out on the road,","1"

We know it’s serious when a couple moves in together. Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, however, isn’t your average couple moving in together, so when they do — they do it big. The couple — who’ve been hot and heavy for a year now, are taking their relationship to the next level by purchasing a penthouse together.

While the couple have been basically living together at Jennifer’s house in Los Angeles, they have now gone in on something as a real committed unit. It’s being reported that J.Lo and A.Rod have been thinking of moving in together for a few months now. Jennifer put up her previous penthouse ( $27 million!) on the market in October. So what’s up with the new place? Here are some deets:

The penthouse is located at 432 Park Avenue — also known as the tallest residential building in Manhattan. It cost the couple a whopping $15.32 million (why does it sound like a step down from her previous place?).

"OJ Simpson ‘Demanding’ To Meet Khloe Kardashian’s Baby, Per ‘Radar Online’
OJ Simpson allegedly is demanding to meet Khloe Kardashian’s new daughter with Tristan Thompson, True Thompson, per a new report by Radar Online .

For years, rumors have followed Kardashian that O.J. Simpson is her biological father. It was alleged that Kris Jenner carried on a secret affair with the former pro-football player during her marriage to Simpson’s lawyer, Robert Kardashian.

Jenner admitted in her book, Kris Jenner and All Things Kardashian , to an affair around the time Kardashian was conceived.

Sources tell Radar Online that Simpson is demanding to see his new “granddaughter.” This allegation has not been confirmed by either the Kardashian clan or Simpson himself.

During a 2012 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kris asked if her daughter would take a DNA test regarding her true paternity; Kardashian refused.

“Seriously, my dad is Robert Kardashian. My other dad is Bruce Jenner,” Khloe reeled, continuing to her mother, “If you f***ed other people during the same time and you do not know, go on Maury!” Kim Kardashian later approached her sister and told her that their mother was upset by her reluctance to take the test.

Khloe Kardashian then penned a letter to her mother which was read on the E! series.

“I don’t need someone to tell me who my family is. I have had the blessing of having two phenomenal fathers. I don’t need a DNA test to prove who my father is.”

Radar reported that a source at the Nevada prison where Simpson was incarcerated claims that Jenner called Simpson “at least once a week” and begged him to take a DNA test to put to rest rumors of her daughter’s paternity.

The source allegedly stated, “O.J. believes now more than ever that Khloe is his daughter because True looks so much like his son Justin did when he was a baby.”

OJ Simpson is a father to four children; Arnelle, 49, and Jason, 48, from his first marriage to Marguerite Whitley; and Sydne","1"
"Kylie Jenner: Why She Finally Broke Down & Hired Nannies For Stormi After Insisting She Wouldn’t
Looks like Kylie Jenner, 20, has gotten off her high horse about not wanting help with her baby daughter Stormi Webster! During her pregnancy, the makeup mogul insisted she would raise her child on her own without ANY nannies, but since the baby’s birth, Kylie has found herself in over her head. As a result, she’s hired a significant amount of help — cue the I-told-you-so’s! But hey, at least the 20-year-old can admit when she’s wrong, right? Click here to see adorable pics of baby Stormi.

“Kylie had every intention of raising Stormi without nannies but it didn’t take very long for her to admit that she needs help,” a source close to Kylie shared with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “She went three nights in a row without really sleeping. After that she broke down and hired night nurses.” Once Kylie got a taste of what that was like, she apparently couldn’t resist asking for even more assistance. “That was such a big help she very quickly started hiring more staff for her and Stormi,” our insider explained. “Her mom is still helping her but she’s got her own life, she’s not giving that up.”

Of course Kylie’s opinionated family is rubbing her nose in it a little bit, after all, she was SO convinced she could take care of Stormi all on her own. “Kylie had to eat a little humble pie when she agreed to hire nannies because she made such a big deal about how she wasn’t going to do it,” the source added. “She definitely said some things that were a little offensive to her sisters about them using nannies, they’re giving her a hard time about it now.”

At first, Kylie said she only wanted family members around her child, but once Stormi arrived, she realized that wasn’t very realistic. With the extra set of hands, it seems Kylie and her baby daddy, Travis Scott, 25, are handling parenting well. In fact, the two are on better terms than ever now, as Travis recently gave Kylie a","1"
"Johnny Depp Sues Business Managers For $25M Over Fraud
Like many an actor before him, Johnny Depp believes he has been swindled in the Hollywood accounting shell game — by his own business managers and lawyers. In a lawsuit filed today, the Pirates Of The Caribbean star is going after The Management Group for more than $25 million in a jury-seeking suit alleging fraud and several other claims.

“As a result of years of gross mismanagement and sometimes outright fraud, Mr. Depp lost tens of millions of dollars and has been forced to dispose of significant assets to pay for TMG’s self-dealing and gross misconduct,” reads the 52-page complaint (read it here) filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by the actor and fellow Plaintiff Edward L. White as trustees of the Mooh Investment Trust.

The lawsuit alleges 11 complaints ranging from fraud to breach of contract to professional negligence. It claims TMG paid itself more than $28 million in contingency fees without a written agreement; failed to file or pay his taxes on time, resulting in more than $5.6 million in fees and penalties on his federal returns; and “loaning” nearly $10 million to third parties without Depp’s authorization or proper documentation.

Watch on Deadline

“In essence, TMG treated Mr. Depp’s income as their own, available to either TMG or third parties to draw upon as desired,” read the complaint filed by attorneys at Los Angeles-based Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLC.

“TMG’s gross mismanagement and fraud remained undetected as TMG borrowed millions of dollars to survive from movie-to-movie,” add the filing.

“It was only recently, when Mr. Depp terminated TMG and hired new business management and accounting services, when Mr. Depp learned the gravity of his financial losses and some, but surely not all, of the underlying facts,” the complain states bluntly, also adding that the management firm is seeking foreclosure on Depp’s primary home through a loan the actor says came from TMG’s own self-dealing.

Date night?! Katie Holmes goes for dinner with a mystery man

Back in the game! A sleek and sexy-looking Katie Holmes is all smiles as she steps out for a posh dinner date with a new man

Looking good, girl! As they say in New Yoik (Image: Splash)

Swit-swoo! Someone's looking hawt after their post-break-up make-over!

‌



Gone are the bad jeans and the 'Mummy tops'. Newly-single Katie Holmes had a whole new look when she went out for dinner last night.

‌



And we like it! Wearing a sexy black leather jacket and an elegant green maxi-dress, all glammed up with a boxy clutch-bag, Katie looked the best we've seen her for ages.

‌



Single life obviously suits her.

Katie met her mystery friend for dinner at trendy restaurant Nomad in New York.

And even gave him a peck on the cheek as he put her in a taxi at the end of the night.

‌



He was wearing a wedding ring though, so we're guessing they're just mates.

But still, it's nice to get taken out for dinner and stuff.

That's quite a lingering goodnight peck (Image: Splash) Katie could deffers do better (Image: Splash)

‌



Katie looks pretty WOW you have to admit (Image: Splash)

It looks like an episode of Sex and The City - and Katie would SO be Charlotte.

Katie was due to make her first red-carpet appearance post-divorce tonight at the Dizzy Feet Foundation gala in LA, but she decided to pull out.

‌



Probably so she could go on more fun date nights in New York.

But if Katie's had a glam-over, six-year-old Suri is taking a back-seat in the fashion stakes.

She took a break from the designer frocks and heels and went out in, um, a blanket the other day.

"Summer Music Preview: Drake, Nicki Minaj, Ariana Grande, and So Much Kanye

Every summer, rumors of Big Deal releases from marquee artists run rampant. This summer, the same thing is happening, but there’s one crucial difference: Artists are throwing everything they have into projects with actual concrete release dates. By the end of June alone, we’re all but guaranteed to have new albums from Kanye West, Drake, Pusha-T, Christina Aguilera, and much more. By the end of summer, there’s a very real chance that a Beyoncé and Jay-Z album could exist … or maybe not? Check out the list of just some of the (major, major) highlights of this summer’s stacked crop of album releases. If all of these actually come out in the next three months, maybe everyone can take the rest of the year off from making music so we can catch up.

Chvrches, Love Is Dead (May 25)

Chvrches never gets enough credit for arriving early to modern pop music’s booming trap/EDM party, but one hopes the new Love Is Dead will win the Glasgow trio the respect it deserves for its solid track record of windswept hooks and disarming lyrics. The sticky melodies and explosive drums of the new single “Miracle” seem to suggest that lead singer Lauren Mayberry and her bandmates Martin Doherty and Iain Cook are playing for keeps the third time around. —Craig Jenkins

Pusha-T, Daytona (May 25)

As far as excuses for not releasing an album go, being president of Kanye West’s record label isn’t bad at all. The sequel to Pusha-T’s 2013 solo debut, My Name Is My Name, has been awaited for so long that many a fan might have forgotten to await it any longer; even the brief prelude album, Darkest Before Dawn, that Push released to tide listeners over is three years old at this point. To be sure, the ex-Clipse rapper has had his hands full since being named head of GOOD Music (just imagine having to field responses to Kanye’s recent antics), but he’s long overdue for a collection of his own qual","1"
"Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner Finalize Their Divorce 3 Years After Split
Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are moving forward with their divorce.

The former couple has settled their divorce case, ET has learned. A judgement was filed on Aug. 9 to finalize the divorce, however, a judge has not signed off or officially approved the judgement, meaning the pair is still not yet officially divorced.

According to TMZ, who was first to report the news, the two -- who didn't have a prenup -- have reached a property settlement and agreed to joint custody of their three kids, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.

ET has reached out to both Affleck and Garner's reps.

The news comes two weeks after ET learned that Garner and Affleck's divorce case was on the verge of being dismissed. The notice was the actress' third notice of case review from a judge, who requested that she take action immediately.

Garner and Affleck announced their separation in 2015, and filed for divorce last April. Despite their split, the former pair have remained on good terms as they continue to co-parent their kids. Garner was even photographed driving Affleck to an L.A. rehab facility on Wednesday. A source previously told ET that the actress is ""relieved"" that Affleck, who has been open about his struggles with alcoholism, was ""in a safe place.""

""This has been a rough few days and [Jennifer] wants nothing more than to feel [Ben] is getting the help that he needs,"" the source said, adding that Garner has ""been Ben's rock"" throughout this process. ""She is used to putting on a brave face, and handling Ben's addiction, but the process has been very exhausting for her. She won't give up on Ben because he is the father of her kids.""

"Celebrities react to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tied the knot on Saturday in front of 600 guests at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor, England.

The beautiful ceremony was unlike any other in British royal history — and it was star-studded. George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, and Sir Elton John were just a few of the many celebs in attendance to witness the blessed event.

Prior to the nuptials, Markle’s friend Serena Williams tweeted out a few shots of her and hubby Alex Ohanian all decked out in their formal attire. “Ready for my friend’s wedding,” tweeted the tennis superstar.

The Duchess of Sussex’s former Suits costar (and onscreen love interest) Patrick J. Adams also made the guest list, but posted a special message for the bride the night before.

Of course, many more celebs and other personalities were either covering the festivities in England for various media outlets or watching the celebration from the comfort of their couches. It clearly was not as good as being there, but it was much easier for those who did not score invites to share their thoughts regarding the royal wedding on social media.

"Justin Theroux and Petra Collins Are Rumored To Be Dating
It's only been about a month since Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston announced their separation, but The Leftovers star is already getting caught up in romance rumors—and they involve Selena Gomez's director BFF, Petra Collins. Daily Mail reports that the two have met up for dinner dates after meeting in the New York art scene, but Theroux insists they're just friends.

Neither have confirmed, let alone responded to, the dating gossip yet. But Theroux, 46, did previously share a photo with Collins, 25, last month on Instagram. (They also follow each other on the app.) Both wear Adam Selman graphic tees in the faceless post, and Collins is tagged.





Despite the suspicions, details on the two's relationship—platonic or not—remain clouded. However, fans are curious whether the rumored fling has any connection to the fact that Selena Gomez recently unfollowed Collins on Instagram, despite their close friendship. (Collins still follows Gomez, though.)

The pair first met in 2015, when Petra photographed Selena for Wonderland Magazine, and went on to become friends and creative collaborators. Collins directed Gomez's raunchy ""Fetish"" music video, which released last summer, and shot some of her promo photos. Last fall, they even talked about the possibility of writing a movie together. They were last seen in public together during New York Fashion Week last month, according to Elle.

Strangely enough, Theroux also gave a shoutout to Gomez on Instagram. In his first post after announcing his split from Aniston, the actor mentioned the singer in the hashtags: ""#selenagomez #Yeahthatsrightselenaididittoyouagainbutifyousawtheseguysyouddowhateveryoucouldtooalsoiknowyourechilllikethat.""

"Pregnant and Still Thin
Photo: Katherine Wolkoff

Fourteen weeks pregnant with her first child, Margot Tenenbaum secretly wished she were a bit more nauseous. As it was, she controlled her mild bouts of queasiness with pasta and pizza, but if she’d been just a notch sicker every once in a while, she might have felt too bad to eat at all. Who knows? Maybe she would have even thrown up.

The thought occurred to her, she sheepishly concedes, at a celebratory brunch in Brooklyn with her husband and another couple who are expecting a child. The other mother-to-be, already a stick before she was pregnant, was telling the group how miserable her morning sickness had been and how she’d lost eight pounds so far in her first trimester.

“And I was saying,” Tenenbaum recalls, “how that’s not my experience. And she said, ‘You should be grateful you’re not sick.’ Then she went on to say, ‘I never wore maternity clothes during my first pregnancy.’ ” Tenenbaum, who in neat, distressing symmetry had already gained eight pounds, hastens to note that she doesn’t think her friend was being rude. “I keep telling myself, We’re different body types. But it’s hard. I’m not thinking, It’s okay to get bigger. I’m pregnant. I’m thinking, This is depressing.”

To be clear, Margot Tenenbaum is not the fat girl. Though, at 38, she’s had “chubby periods,” for the past seven years or so, she’s been happy with her size-8 self (that’s at Barneys or Jeffrey, she clarifies; size 6 at Old Navy). Beyond that, Tenenbaum is the kind of New York woman other New York women get girl-crushes on. She’s exuberant and witty and sexy, managing to look like those Citizens of Humanity jeans aren’t fashiony but her own brilliant discovery, and she seems to know everybody. Raised in Savannah, Georgia, she’s friendly with the director Wes Anderson, who named The Royal Tenenbaums and the Gwyneth Paltrow character after Margot and her family.

"Angelina Jolie’s parental choices must have really worried judge overseeing Brad Pitt custody fight, experts say
Despite what you see in legal dramas, judges presiding over divorce and custody disputes are reluctant in real life to tell parents how to parent their kids, family law experts say.

They certainly don’t like to threaten a parent with a loss of custody rights unless they have serious concerns about how that parent is conducting him or herself.

For that reason, a judge’s reported rebuke of Angelina Jolie and his ruling that she’s at risk of losing primary custody of her six children to Brad Pitt is remarkable, according to Christopher Melcher, a Los Angeles-based family law attorney who has worked with a number or high-profile clients.

“The court generally expects parents to make the best decisions for their children and family, but when a parent is proving they’re not acting in that way, the court will start imposing sanctions,” Melcher told this media organization.

Melcher, who is not associated with the case, added that it’s pretty “rare” for a judge to tell a parent he or she could lose custody if a certain behavior doesn’t change. “I imagine there were some pretty serious warning signs before the judge made this ruling,” he said.

According to documents obtained by the website The Blast, the actress, director and humanitarian needs to do a much better job than she has of fostering her children’s relationship with Pitt. The couple, who split in September 2016, share children Maddox, 16; Pax, 14; Zahara, 13; Shiloh, 12; and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9.

The documents make it sound as though Jolie, 42, has not cooperated in allowing Pitt, 54, to spend time with the children this summer or in letting him have easy and unmonitored cell phone and text message contact with them.

Melcher said the ruling from the retired Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, who likely was retained by both parties to resolve the case, is “consistent with a finding of par","1"
"Martin Landau dead: Celebrities react
Martin Landau, perhaps most known for his Oscar-winning performance as Bela Lugosi in 1994’s Ed Wood, died Saturday at age 89.

"The Sun: Brad Pitt ‘will absolutely’ want to introduce Neri Oxman to his six kids
Embed from Getty Images

At this point, it shouldn’t be shocking that every tabloid and every weekly gossip magazine is covering Brad Pitt’s romance with Neri Oxman. It’s worth noting that we only heard about Neri Oxman for the first time on April 5th, which was when Page Six published their exclusive. Since then, People Magazine, Us Weekly, E! News, the Daily Mail and The Sun have all run exclusives about Brad and Neri and how their love is once-in-a-generation and everything is sunshine and roses and deep, intellectual conversations about architecture. I don’t even know what to say at this point, so just enjoy these quotes from The Sun’s “insider.”

Brad’s series of upgrades: “Brad always does a lot of soul-searching after a break-up, analysing how he can find the perfect partner. Each time he goes looking for a new relationship, his wish list of demands gets longer. Friends joke that he is almost upgrading each time, until he finally settles for good. For years, he has been content to look within Hollywood for his next girlfriend. But after the split with Angelina, he was encouraged to look outside of the Los Angeles fame bubble. This has led to him falling for Neri. It is very much a meeting of minds first — it is not just physical attraction. Their chemistry is hot.” After a year of “loneliness,” Brad was ready for Neri: “Brad is besotted with Neri and cannot wait to shout their love from the rooftops. He is mesmerised by her intellect, her cool philosophy on life and of course their shared love of arts and design. He is also saying she’s the sexiest woman he’s ever laid eyes on.” Brad doesn’t want to rub it in Angelina’s face: “Brad and Angelina made a pact when they split that they wouldn’t step out with other people until their divorce terms were formally agreed. That didn’t stop either of them from quietly dating other people but he has been very clear about not rubbing her fa","1"
"Brad Pitt Reportedly Majorly Crushing On Margot Robbie: He’s ‘Smitten’
Image Credit: John Salangsang/John Milne/Shutterstock

Work hard, play hard! Brad Pitt, 54, and Margot Robbie, 28, have reportedly been flirting it up on the set of their forthcoming film, Once a Time in Hollywood. “It’s obvious that Brad’s completely smitten with Margot,” a source tells Life & Style magazine. Their upcoming film also stars Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, who’s even reportedly noticed the close camaraderie between Brad and Margot. Leo “has called him out for layering it on so thick [with Margot],” the insider adds. — While this is adorable and all, nothing about this alleged relationship has been confirmed.

And, let’s not forget that Margot is a married woman. She tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend, Tom Ackerley, a film director, back in December 2016. She and Ackerley had a low key, secretive wedding on a beach in Australia’s Byron Bay, according to reports, where she wore an Oscar de la Renta gown. After much speculation, Margot finally confirmed she had said, “I do,” with an Instagram post (on December 19, 2016) from her wedding day. The actress posted a photo of her diamond ring as she and Ackerley shared a sweet kiss outdoors.

Since Brad knows all of this, he’s reportedly been nothing but professional and respectful of Margot’s marriage. “Brad insists he knows she’s off limits,” the insider tells the mag, adding that Brad is “just awed by Margot’s talent.” And, we can’t blame him about that! The source also notes that Brad, who’s always been a fan of Margot’s work, helped the actress land her role in The Big Short.

Brad’s been a single man since late 2016, after he and actress Angelina Jolie, 43, called it quits in September of that year. The two went through a nasty and very public divorce and custody battle, until they decided to have the court docs sealed for the sake of their children’s privacy.

Chris Pratt looked like a single guy back in the dating saddle as he met up with a woman ... who happens to look a lot like his estranged wife.

The ""Jurassic World"" star was at an L.A. Coffee Bean Wednesday, and had a friendly embrace with the hot mystery blonde.

It's unclear if this was a romantic hookup, or purely platonic ... but, fact is, a lot of people in Hollywood are anxiously waiting for Chris to get back on the dating scene after last year's split from Anna Faris.

We know Anna's moved on with cinematographer Michael Barrett -- he's even met her parents.","1"
"Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson spark reconciliation rumors with L.A. sighting
Twihards are having a hard time containing their delight because, as improbable as it sounds, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were spotted hanging out together at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles Saturday night.

And six years after their three-year relationship came crashing down over reports that Stewart was cheating on Pattinson with married director Rupert Sanders, rumors have been swirling that the two are considering a reconciliation.

This is all according to the Daily Mail, which published grainy photos of Stewart and Pattinson, looking like they were having a chill time together, hanging out by a car outside a party at Chateau Marmont for Lily-Rose Depp.

https://twitter.com/multifandomacc5/status/1003247646423863296

Stewart, 28, was wearing a black ensemble and appeared to be smoking, while Pattinson, 32, was wearing jeans, a graphic T-shrirt and black cap.

The idea of the “Twilight’s” Bella and Edward reconciling romantically in real life seems improbable because of the high-profile humiliation Pattinson likely suffered when Stewart was caught in a cheating scandal.

She was photographed in an intimate embrace with Sanders, her director for “Snow White and the Huntsman,” who was 19 years her senior. She and Sanders issued a very public apology to Pattinson.

When the Twilight series ended in 2012, Stewart and Pattinson seemed to go their separate ways both professionally and romantically.

Each has earned critical praise and International awards consideration for leaving blockbuster fare behind and starring in smaller, indie films. Meanwhile, Stewart came out as bisexual and began seriously dating model Stella Maxwell in late 2016, while Pattinson became engaged to U.K. singer FKA Twigs.

But Pattinson’s engagement to Twigs reportedly ended in October, while the Daily Mail, citi","1"
"Alexander Skarsgard gushes over Tarzan co-star Margot Robbie
Margot Robbie recently admitted she was left speechless at the sight of her Tarzan co-star's amazing body.

And it seems the appreciation works both ways, with Alexander Skarsgard gushing about his Australian co-star's 'stunning' beauty but adding her relaxed and fun personality makes her even more beautiful.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph after posing alongside some furry critters at Sydney Zoo on Tuesday, the 39-year-old said the pair's chemistry was undeniable, revealing: 'Margot and I had just a really deep connection from day one, we really found each other'.

King of the jungle: Alexander Skarsgard gushed about his 'stunning' Tarzan co-star Margot Robbie while at Sydney Zoo on Tuesday

'Margot and I had just a really deep connection from day one': The Sweedish hunk said he and the Australian actress had an instant connection

He added that the blonde beauty was exactly what they were looking for in their Jane - strong, tough and independent.

However, the True Blood actor says the former Neighbours actress is not just physically beautiful, saying: 'What makes Margot so beautiful is not only that she’s a stunningly gorgeous woman, but that she is not vain,

'Margot is so down to earth and fun and that makes it even more attractive,' he added.

Meanwhile, Alexander appeared to be unphased by the dusty environment of the zoo, choosing to wear a pair of slick pair of dress shoes and a glamorous wrist watch.

And despite his prior jungle king-like confidence, Alexander became slightly concerned when a snake wrapped itself tightly around his neck.

The True Blood actor also spent quality time with a troop of friendly kangaroos; offering them a juicy branch of eucalyptus leaves as a welcome gift.

"Kanye West Leaves Kim Kardashian After Massive Fight – See Details
Just when it seemed things couldn’t get any worse.…They did. Capping of a tumultuous week of bizarre rants and a Trump-related Twitter firestorm, Kanye West showed up in the TMZ newsroom on May 1 and dropped a few new bombshells. During a rambling 42-minute interview, the erratic rapper announced that he’d been hooked on opioids after liposuction in 2016 and declared that ""when you hear about slavery for 400 years…that sounds like a choice."" His shocking comments were met with instant backlash from fans, fellow celebrities and especially his own wife, Kim Kardashian.

""She’s just so mad at him for embarrassing her — and her family — over and over and over again,"" says a Kardashian source, noting that Kim is fearful about how Kanye’s behavior affects everything from their children to the Kardashians’ public image and business empire. The pair fought bitterly, adds an insider, because ""Kanye was furious that she would even try to silence him. He stormed off, leaving Kim in tears."" Now with Kanye, 40, holed up at a Wyoming resort — purportedly to work on his music — Kim, 37, is facing the fact that her third marriage is in free fall. ""She’s more humiliated than ever,"" says the source. ""Her sisters and mom, Kris Jenner, are asking her how much more of this she can take.""

She’s put up with so much already. ""Kim has tried to talk to Kanye about the effect his words are having, not only on his friends and his fans, but on those closest to him,"" says the insider, noting that she’s been living in fear for the family — including kids North, Saint, and Chicago — after rapper Daz Dillinger urged the notorious Crips gang to “f— Kanye up.”

While Kanye brushed of the danger during his TMZ rant, he and Kim did appear to beef up security, says the insider: ""They’re taking this very seriously."" All of the Kardashians are on red alert. ""This is most definitely a family crisis,"" says the insider. ""Everyone has been in","1"
"Kaley Cuoco Gives Update on Shoulder Surgery Recovery: 'Ice Is My Best Friend'
Kaley Cuoco has a new appreciation for ice following her recent shoulder surgery.

Documenting her recovery process on Saturday, the Big Bang Theory star, 32, shared a video of herself icing her healing shoulder on her Instagram Story.

“Day 3 in the same shirt,” she wrote alongside a video, as a bag of ice cubes rested on her shoulder. “Braids are hanging in. Karl might have to re-do them. Could write a sitcom around his hairstyles.”

Alongside the video, she also proclaimed that right now “ice is my best friend.”

In a separate video, Cuoco also shared that her dog Ruby seemed really happy the actress was staying at home while she recovered from the procedure.

“Ruby is so happy I had surgery because she just gets to lay and stare at me for hours on end,” she remarked in the video, before asking the canine, “Is this your dream?”

Kaley Cuoco/Instagram

The actress previously revealed that although she underwent surgery a mere five days after tying the knot with husband Karl Cook, a surprise injury wasn’t responsible for the procedure.

“This was a planned surgery I’ve had for over a year,” she explained in her Instagram Story earlier this week.

“I hurt [my shoulder] over a year ago and did not need immediate surgery so brilliantly planned it five days after our wedding,” she continued. “I knew I’d have a babysitter.”

Kaley Cuoco/Instagram

She also added that she plans to “lay low” during the recovery process, which could last up to six weeks.

“I’m in a pretty big cast. No horsies for a minute. Time to lay low and hopefully not kill this guy,” she said as she panned the camera over to Cook. “Or him kill me.”

"Beyonce and Jay-Z Building Million Dollar Nursery For Twins?
Beyonce is pregnant with twins, as everybody on the planet knows by now. And according to a new report, Beyonce also wants to built a million dollar nursery for these twins. Okay, actually, Beyonce and Jay-Z want to build this nursery. But let’s be real – if Beyonce wants something, you think Jay-Z is going to say no?

And also, when was the last time we saw Jay-Z claiming to want something, and Beyonce jumping on that bandwagon? And don’t say a divorce #neverforgetthelevatorincident. Anyway, Radar’s source claims, “Beyonce told Jay Z she wants a million-dollar nursery in her home! The place will have two of everything. It must have two lamps, changing tables, cribs, stuffed animals and a closet stocked with baby designer duds from Lanvin and Hermes…. money is no object. It has to be perfect.”

Well, duh to that last part. ‘Money is no object’, as though that even needed to be stated. Truthfully, the fact that this is news is somewhat mind boggling. Why does the fact that Beyonce wants a fancy, expensive nursery need to become a thing? In fact, it would have been more news-worthy had Beyonce NOT wanted a million dollar nursery? Have you SEEN Blue Ivy’s clothes?!

The more interesting part of this report is the fact that Beyonce ‘told’ Jay-Z she wants a million dollar nursery, not that Jay-Z is ‘enthusiastic’ about a million dollar nursery. Again, what Beyonce wants, Beyonce gets. But the phrasing of this report is definitely curious; it was alleged for a while that Jay-Z and Beyonce were still biding their time to announce a separation, or at least, a trial separation – and then bam, the announcement that came instead was that Beyonce was pregnant with twins. It’s hard to believe that everything is suddenly hunky dory just because Beyonce is pregnant now.

If anything, the problems between the two are likely amplified, but we’re not hearing anything because Beyonce shut down the leaks in her camp. And now,","1"
"Denzel Washington supports Trump (FALSE)
This meme — the notion that in 2016 actor Denzel Washington publicly supported then-presidential candidate Donald Trump — is an example of a false claim that has evolved over time as it has spread across social media and on a variety of unreliable websites. Other iterations of this rumor falsely quoted Washington as saying that when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, “we avoided a war with Russia, and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state.”

This rumor first went viral in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. It resurfaced in February 2018 when Washington was nominated for an Oscar — and appeared yet again in April 2018, after musician Kanye West tweeted a statement of support for Trump, reigniting longstanding discussions about the political loyalties of black American voters.

Insight: Viral rumors often recirculate when new contexts for them emerge.

What can we learn?

Let’s start with an instance of this viral meme that was included in a post on a highly suspect website — USALibertyPress.com — in February 2018:

Note: The link in the previous paragraph is to an archive of the “fake news” website. That avoids linking to the site itself and giving it additional web traffic and ad revenue.

The first step we should take is to do a little lateral reading* on the claim itself. So let’s do a quick search:

All the top results for this search are from fact-checking organizations, so we can safely assume that this is a questionable claim. A quick read of the fact checks confirms that the claims in both the headline and the meme on the Liberty Press website are false. PolitiFact traced the headline claim to a well-known “fake news” website, YourNewsWire.com, and Snopes shows that the quote attributed to Washington was actually said by Charles Evers, the brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, in an interview with the New York Post.

"What’s Going on With Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s Divorce?
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Photo: Getty Images

Two years ago, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie dropped a bombshell: the Hollywood power couple was splitting up after two years of marriage but roughly 12 years together. What followed were months of back and forth between the (former) couple in the press. There were leaks about custody battles and Pitt’s reported drinking and weed smoking; meanwhile, Pitt gave a candid interview with GQ about the split and his new passion for sculpture and R&B music.

Last summer, there were a slew of new stories, court filings, and suspicious tabloid take-downs in this seemingly never-ending saga. But on Friday, a judge reportedly declared both Pitt and Jolie to be legally single – though their divorce settlement has not yet been finalized.

Here, a look at all that has happened with Brangelina’s divorce.

First, can we look back at their … uh … happier … days?

Sure. The coupling of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is already Hollywood legend. The pair met while filming Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2004 — back when Pitt was still married to Jennifer Aniston. Rumors about what may or may not have gone down between Pitt and Jolie on set ran rampant. Eventually, he and Aniston split up, and his relationship with Jolie (officially) came to light. But despite their, erm, salacious start, Pitt and Jolie proved to be the real deal. They were involved for 12 years, and had six kids and a French vineyard together.

So what went wrong?

Back in September 2016, we learned that an “incident” reportedly went down on a private plane, and that the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services and FBI got involved. That “incident,” which reportedly involved Pitt and son Maddox Jolie-Pitt, is said to be what prompted Jolie to file for divorce. But in an interview with Vanity Fair in 2017, Jolie made it pretty clear she didn’t want to talk on the record about what happened.

Ah, okay. But what’s","1"
"Authorities Responded to Scott Disick's Home in August for Possible Psychiatric Hold: Reports
Authorities responded to Scott Disick‘s home in August for a possible 5150 psychiatric hold, according to multiple reports.

A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Fire Department confirmed to PEOPLE that on Aug. 18, they were dispatched to a home in Hidden Hills, California, at 4:56 p.m. They arrived on the scene at 5:03 p.m.

Lost Hills Sheriffs also responded to assist, and one patient was transported to a local hospital.

According to E! News, the call was made from Disick’s home, though the identity of the patient remains unclear.

Entertainment Tonight reported the same, adding that the Los Angeles County Fire Department confirmed that the patient, who was male, was non-violent when authorities arrived at the residence before being transported to the hospital.

A 5150 hold is an involuntary psychiatric hold that occurs when a person is deemed to be a danger to either themselves or others. The patient can be held in a psychiatric hospital for up to 72 hours, unless it is extended. According to The Blast, Disick was released prior to that.

“Scott is definitely trying to get better, but he still has bad moments,” a source tells PEOPLE. “When he starts partying, he doesn’t know when to stop. It’s concerning to see. Everyone hopes he’ll continue on a good path.”

Since Aug. 18, Disick has been spotted in public several times, most recently in New York City for Fashion Week, dining with Kim Kardashian at Milo’s restaurant Wednesday night.

Earlier this week, a source told PEOPLE that the 34-year-old is working on bettering himself after a summer of partying hard. The insider said Disick is now monitoring his drinking and has “been feeling better.”

“He’s been really good. He was just in Vegas and didn’t drink,” the source said. “When he felt like he was about to slip, he would call friends who t","1"
"Gwen Stefani Dumped by Blake Shelton Over Jealousy and Drama (EXCLUSIVE)
Music’s hottest couple is a couple no more. Blake Shelton left his girlfriend of two years Gwen Stefani high and dry when he dumped her before heading off on tour in February, In Touch has exclusively learned, and she’s not taking it well. “Gwen doesn’t know what hit her,” said the insider. “She’s heartbroken.”

But wait, Gwen just posted a photo with Blake three days ago, so what gives? Apparently, it’s a desperate attempt to ignore the truth. “She continues to send him loving social media support from LA while he’s been out on the road,” said another insider. “But Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her.” He certainly hasn’t reciprocated her online affection.

“Blake’s through with Gwen’s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women,” explained the source. Apparently, Gwen was jealous over his closeness with The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski, and Blake got sick of trying to make her trust him. “She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.”

“Blake told Gwen that he was going to be doing the latter part of the monthlong Country Freaks Tour without her,” said the source. “Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.” Watch the video below to look back at the couple in happier times.

Even worse, Blake has been looking for solace with newly-single ex-wife Miranda Lambert! “Miranda reached out to Blake via text,” said the insider. “Ultimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships. They’ve become close friends and allies over the past month or so. They have developed into close confidantes and are sharing intimate details of their lives.” We can only imagine how ","1"
"Angelina Jolie takes break from nasty Brad Pitt divorce fight to plead for Syrian refugees
Angelina Jolie has not been enjoying very pleasant headlines lately — not since her divorce and custody battle with Brad Pitt took a dark turn earlier this month.

In the headlines, Jolie has stopped being the serene mother of six, glamorous movie star or compassionate United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees special envoy.

More and more, the 43-year-old Jolie has been accused of being the “crazy and manipulative” estranged wife who has become increasingly “unpopular in Hollywood.” She’s “out for blood” in the divorce fight, or she “wants to embarrass and punish” the seemingly affable Pitt by portraying him in court papers as a deadbeat dad, or by apparently trying to undercut his relationship with their children, as suggested by a family law judge.

Also damning: Page Six reported last week that Jolie had developed “an insane jealousy” jealous of Amal Clooney, the international human rights attorney and wife of George Clooney. Jolie believes “Amal has stolen her identity” as the world’s most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six.

But breaking through all these negative headlines Tuesday was a reminder from Jolie herself of her world-class humanitarian credentials. She published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency’s efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children.

The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.

But as Jolie noted, she wrote her piece to advance important news: The UNHRC is about to publish a report in which the UN agency warns about the rising numbers of refugee children who are not receiving an education.

In any case, Jolie brought her cinematic story-telling experience to share moving accounts of what education means to children — girls especially — whose lives and commu","1"

Rumours: The 20-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, who is yet to publicly confirm her baby news, attended her mum Kris Jenner's annual Christmas Eve bash with her rapper beau yet just days later US sources have claimed they have broken up

Kylie was first hit with widespread speculation that she is expecting Travis' child in September yet since then she has remained uncharacteristically coy on both social media and in the glare of the public eye.

Kylie and Travis began dating in April - in the weeks following her split from ex-beau Tyga. After months of questions over the state of their relationship, the couple's pictures together at Kris' party seemed to indicate they are very much together.

Just six days later, sources have claimed the couple have parted ways after Travis ended the romance - while vowing to always be there for the tot.

Insiders said: 'He finally plucked up the courage to tell Kylie he’s done, that he loves her and will always be around for the baby, but they’re not compatible as a couple. Kylie was totally blindsided even though everyone else in her life saw this coming.

Justin Bieber came unstuck on Sunday at the BST Hyde Park concert with a nightmare performance which left a packed crowd scratching their heads.

And things went from bad to worse when he publicly scolded his backing singers for talking in-between songs, sneering: 'Whatever you're talking about can't be more important than what I'm saying,' leaving his audience stunned.

The problems began early when the Sorry hit-maker pointed out the Merry-go-round near the stage and joked: 'That looks fun... Said no one ever!'

Sadly, the discerning British crowd failed to see the funny side of Bieber's wisecrack leaving him to awkwardly tap his microphone and quip: 'Is this thing on?' before adding: 'Tough crowd!'

In the singer's defense, it appears as if he was nursing a cold.

Fans who’ve been rooting for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston ever since their 2005 split may actually have cause for hope! Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.“They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”“He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.Have something to add to the story?

"The Biggest Celebrity Feuds of 2017
There was no shortage of celebrity beefs in 2017.

Whether the fights were between co-stars or once close friends, the shade just kept coming. Let's take a look back at the most intense celebrity feuds of the year.

1. Blac Chyna vs. Rob Kardashian

Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian's split turned a new level of nasty when the former couple exchanged wild accusations against one another in a heated, NSFW social media war in June. Kardashian shared graphic naked photos of Chyna, accused her of cheating on him multiple times and also accused her of being on drugs. Meanwhile, Chyna took to Snapchat to accuse Kardashian of also cheating on her and being physically abusive.

One month later, a judge granted Chyna's request for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian.

""Revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,"" Chyna's attorney, Lisa Bloom, said during a press conference.

But the two now appear to be keeping it amicable when it comes to their daughter, 1-year-old Dream. In September, the two reached a custody agreement.

""Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully co-parent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,"" Bloom said in a statement.

Kardashian’s attorney, Robert Shapiro, also told ET at the time that ""Rob and Chyna are working together to put the best interest of their child first and have amicably resolved their personal matters.""

Of course, Chyna is still suing Kardashian, his mom Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian West over the cancellation of E!’s Rob & Chyna.

2. Dwayne Johnson vs. Tyrese Gibson

Show Caption Hide Caption Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie attempting to have amicable divorce Still working things out. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have requested to extend the temporary judge working on their divorce settlement, a source confirms to Us Weekly. Wochit

Celebrity blog The Blast reported Wednesday that Springfield native Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are continuing to make divorce arrangements, and they've taken steps to keep the discussions out of the public eye for now.

The news was quickly picked up by national outlets such as People.

The Blast reported that both parties recently filed court documents to extend a ""temporary judge"" oversight period on their divorce case, allowing it to remain private while Pitt and Jolie continue to discuss dividing up assets and custody of their six children.

Currently, the blog reported, Jolie has custody of Maddox, Zahara, Pax, Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne. Pitt has visitation rights.

The blog cited anonymous sources who portrayed ongoing talks between Pitt and Jolie as ""very amicable.""

The two film actors met on the set of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" in 2003, when Pitt was still married to actor Jennifer Aniston of ""Friends"" fame.

""Brangelina,"" as the couple is frequently named in celebrity media, got engaged in 2012, stating they did not plan to marry until same-sex marriage was legal across the United States.

In August 2014, 10 months before same-sex marriages were legal, they married in a surprise ceremony in France, where Jolie has family.

Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016, citing irreconcilable differences.

Brad's younger brother, Doug Pitt, is a Springfield-area entrepreneur who does philanthropic work with local charities such as Care to Learn and international ones such as WorldServe.

After getting back together, Jenner and Scott split again toward the end of 2022



Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott's relationship has had its ups and downs.

The beauty mogul and rapper first sparked romance rumors after being spotted holding hands together at Coachella in 2017. Then Jenner and Scott decided to take their love on the road, with Jenner revealing to GQ in 2018 that she joined Scott on tour.

""He said, 'I'm going back on tour — what do we want to do about this?' Because we obviously liked each other,"" the reality TV star said in the joint interview with Scott. ""And I was like, 'I guess I'm going with you' ... And then we rode off into the sunset.""

However, after two years of dating and welcoming their first child together in February 2018, the pair split in October 2019. During their time apart, Jenner and Scott remained friendly while co-parenting their daughter, Stormi. By the summer of 2021, the couple reunited, and Jenner later announced on Instagram that she was pregnant with their second child (born in February 2022).

The couple called it quits for a second time less than a year after welcoming their son. A source told PEOPLE in early January 2023 that Jenner is ""not with"" Scott but that ""this is probably not the end of their relationship.""

""She was beautiful. I cried a little watching her,"" Thomas Markle said on ""Good Morning Britain."" ""I was very proud and I couldn't see a better moment in my life. The whole world was watching my daughter.""

""The unfortunate thing now is that I'm a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history instead of a dad walking his daughter down the aisle,"" he said. ""It was a very emotional moment. I regretted it because I really wanted to walk her down the aisle. But I'm thankful for how it all went.""

Meghan's father admitted to being a bit jealous that he was not at the wedding, but expressed thanks to Prince Charles, Harry's father, for stepping in.

""I can't think of a better replacement than Prince Charles,"" said Markle. ""He looked very handsome. I was jealous, I wish it was me, but thank God he was there and I thank him for that.""

The father of the bride, who described his daughter as a ""princess,"" said that he imagines Prince Charles was thrilled to walk his daughter down the aisle.

""It might have been a treat for him as well because he didn't have a daughter.""

The Prince of Wales has expressed many times how he had always hoped to have a daughter. He has become particularly close to his new daughter-in-law, Meghan.

"Why Prince Harry ""Wanted Out"" of the Royal Family
Prince Harry is certainly one the most beloved members of the royal family, but he almost gave it all up to live a normal life. During a candid interview with the Mail on Sunday, the 32-year-old revealed that he considered giving up his royal life after serving in the army. ""I felt as though I was really achieving something,"" he said of his time serving with the British Army. ""I have a deep understanding of all sorts of people from different backgrounds and felt I was part of a team. I wasn't a prince; I was just Harry.""

When he was forced to leave his first tour of Afghanistan when his location was revealed by the press in 2008, Harry admitted that he went through a bit of a rough patch. ""I spent many years kicking my heels and I didn't want to grow up,"" he said, referring to his partying past. Once he finally got things together though, he seriously contemplated leaving the royal life behind, but his loyalty to his grandmother Queen Elizabeth helped him in his decision to stay. ""I felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself. We don't want to be just a bunch of celebrities, but instead, use our role for good."" And he's certainly doing just that. Aside from creating the Invictus Games to help wounded veterans and their families, Harry has been following in his late mother Princess Diana's footsteps by carrying on her charity work.","1"

"Bradley Cooper On His Role In The New Comedy 'The Hangover: Part II"" : NPR
TERRY GROSS, host:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.

Our guest, actor Bradley Cooper, became widely known to film audiences last year, with the release of ""The Hangover."" He starred with Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis as a crude, wisecracking guy whose trip to Vegas with his buddies for a bachelor party goes very wrong.

Before that, he played the contemptible fiance of Rachel McAdams' character in ""Wedding Crashers,"" and earlier this year, he got his shot at a leading role in ""Limitless,"" where he played a struggling writer who takes a drug that dramatically expands his brainpower.

Though Cooper's acquired an image as a Hollywood hunk, he's an honors graduate in English from Georgetown who didn't get into acting until after college, when he attended the Actors Studio in New York. He grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia, and when he showed up at our studio, he brought along his mom.

Cooper has reunited with most of the original cast of ""The Hangover"" for ""The Hangover Part II,"" where another crazy bachelors' weekend unfolds, this time in Thailand. Bradley Cooper spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies.

DAVE DAVIES, host:

Bradley Cooper, welcome to FRESH AIR.

Mr. BRADLEY COOPER (Actor): Thank you for having me.

DAVIES: The heart of this, of course, is the relationship between you and Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis. And I thought we'd listen to a scene from ""The Hangover,"" that's the first one.

Mr. COOPER: Great.

DAVIES: And this is a moment when you've just gotten into Vegas for what will be a bachelor party couple of days, and you're there in the room with Stu, Ed Helms' character, who has this domineering girlfriend that your character, Phil, absolutely can't stand. And Stu announces to the group that - he pulls out a ring and says he's going to propose.

And Doug, the groom, Justin Bartha, is there. And at the end, we'll hear Zach Galifianakis' character Alan come in. Let's ","1"

To me it’s one of the greatest performances. Casey [Affleck] really nailed it. Me and Casey just tried to focus on what is happening with that character and what he’s trying to do and what is getting in his way. It sounds kind of simple cause you do that with every character. But this character is dealing with a terrible loss while also trying to figure out to function.

"Rihanna Plastic Surgery BEFORE AND AFTER PHOTOS
Did Rihanna Undergo Plastic Surgery?

Rihanna plastic surgery rumours is all about nose jobs and breasts augmentation. Her before and after photos show significant changes in her nose shape. Her bust size increase has given rise to speculations about breast implants. The only way to find out is to compare the before and after pictures of Rihanna over the years.

Rihanna is one of the most popular singers in the world today. With her fame comes the pressure to look good and presentable. Born in 1988, she came to United States at a tender young age of 16 and gained fame at a very young age. And by adding acting to her portfolio, there is a definite need to look young and beautiful.

Her album sales records are hard to refute. Her soaring popularity has seen her working on music together with Eminem, creating hit songs like “ Love the Way You Lie”. But whether we love the way Rihanna is dealing with plastic surgery is another matter.

Rihanna Plastic Surgery Nose Job

One of the most intense speculation is whether Rihanna went for rhinoplasty or nose job. It seems that many singers and actresses are not happy with their natural noses. Rihanna is no exception. Sharp noses are always preferred to rounder and bulbous noses. Based on Rihanna’s latest photos, they bear evidence that she might have enhanced her nose shape deliberately. But Rihanna has never confirmed any nose surgery took place.

"You Need To Calm Down, and the (hopefully) complete history of Taylor Swift and Katy Perry’s feud
It’s an object lesson to us all. No matter how many partners you share or steal, how many backing dancers you tempt away, how much astonishingly unsubtle shade you throw online… there will always be friendship in the end.

That’s assuming, anyway, that the Katy Perry-Taylor Swift feud, which now dates back almost a decade, is truly over – and that détente was accomplished with only a (literal) olive branch, a plate of baked goods, and now a hug at the climax of Swift's new video for You Need To Calm Down.

Who needs Game of Thrones? Here’s a complete timeline – and please, let it be complete – of how two queens of the pop world began, maintained and resolved an unspeakably petty, but quite elaborate, dispute.

Strap in.

July 2009: Taylor Swift shares the love

We begin in 2009, when Swift was on the rise as a pop star, but was still recognised as a country singer. Kanye West’s pro-Beyoncé stage invasion at the MTV VMAs, which would still be a live wire for Swift in 2016 – sit tight, we’ll get there – was several months away.

Perry, meanwhile, was fresh off a tour backed by her breakthrough hit I Kissed a Girl, and racking up international accolades. (The MTV VMAs would be eventful for her, too: she met her husband-to-be Russell Brand at the ceremony.)","1"
"Rachel Weisz Splits With Darren Aronofsky—Does Daniel Craig Figure In?
Despite being together since 2001, engaged since 2005 and having a 4-year-old son, Henry, Weisz had long admitted to being shy about pulling the trigger on marriage.

""Funnily enough, just recently I suddenly felt like I really would like to get married,"" Weisz said during an appearance on The View last January. ""It's just a feeling. I know it's a funny thing.""

Weisz had also gushed to Redbook last year that she and the Wrestler filmmaker were committed ""until death do us part"" although no official vows had been exchanged.

Somewhere along the line things changed.

Notably, there have been rumors about Weisz and Daniel Craig. She and the 007 star allegedly did some serious Bond-ing while working on the film Dream House earlier this year, though neither has confirmed any romance.

As for Aronofsky and Weisz, the couple had been planning to reteam (they previously worked together on 2005's sci-fi flick The Fountain) on a biopic of Jackie Kennedy, but that project no longer is listed on either's IMDb credits.

The couple plan to share custody of Henry and continue to raise him in New York.","1"
"Rihanna Sports Possible Baby Bump In Secret Photo Shoot [PICS]
Rumors of a Rihanna pregnancy have been swirling around the pop star for months now. While there is still no official confirmation, some believe new photos prove that the singer is pregnant…

According to MTO News, Rihanna recently took part in a secret photo shoot in Ibiza.

Although it’s unknown what the shoot was for, the singer appeared to be more full-figured than normal. Some are also saying that they can see a visible baby bump through her sheer white dress.

Neither the pop star nor her billionaire boyfriend, Hassan Jameel, have given a response to the rumors. However, people are noting that the singer has been increasingly wearing loose clothing in recent months, and this could be a sign that she’s trying to keep baby rumors on the down low.

"How to perform a Satanic Destruction Ritual
How to perform a Satanic Destruction Ritual Ali Kellog 9 min read · Dec 31, 2017 -- 12 Listen Share

Zoom image will be displayed Photo by Levan TK (LA Weekly).

I’ve come to learn that rituals are treated very similarly to masturbation in society. It’s something everyone does (whether they like to admit it or not), we’re told to be ashamed of their practice, but they both make us feel good. Rituals are a very personal thing, and seldom understood writ large. If you’re out with people and you tell them you did a ritual earlier that day, odds are you’ll be met with the same response as if you told them you jerked off that morning.

What are rituals?

The truth is, that all of human life is made of rituals.

Mere mention of the word generally conjures images of occult symbols painted on the walls of decrepit basements, animal sacrifice, and strange chanting that reverberates off the walls of horror film scenery and news headlines to assault the American imagination. However, rituals are a universal feature of human cognitive function and social structure. It’s time we reevaluate what the meaning of a ritual is, and recognize the potential (dare I say) benefits of doing such things — specifically here the Destruction Ritual.

Rituals have a strange role in my life. Coming from an academic background in anthropology, the anthropological definition is engrained in my mind. The formal definition in that field is:

“Rituals are actions with intentional symbolic meaning undertaken for a specific cultural purpose, such as a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood, and may reinforce broader community social bonds, as in a wedding. They are used to reinforce social bonds and structure.”

Traditional Oriya Wedding Ceremony in India is a right-of-passage ritual practiced by those of the Hindu faith to ceremonialize the union between two people.

Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kylie Jenner, 20, and her boyfriend Travis Scott have finally confirmed her pregnancy after she gives birth to a baby girl.

After months of speculation, Kim Kardashian West's youngest sister has released a 10 minute video detailing the pregnancy and the safe arrival of her healthy daughter.

The news comes following months of speculation and a Calvin Klein campaign by all the Kardashian sisters that had Kylie fans convinced once and for all she was expecting a child.

Following the announcement that Khloe Kardashian is pregnant with her first baby with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, fans have been calling on the 20 year old to confirm the news, with some furious that she didn't confirm it in a recent KUWTK, when Khloe told her she was pregnant.

Here's everything you need to know about Kylie Jenner's rumoured pregnancy:

Kylie and Travis split?

It was reported Kylie and Travis split in the last few months of her pregnancy but the baby clip - put together by close friends - tells a different story.

Showing Kylie and Travis completely loved up, and in the delivery room as she gave birth only days ago, the duo couldn't be happier.

The Mission: Impossible 6 star also revealed that the movie's title confirming that Top Gun 2 will adopt the lead character's name in the title. The sequel will be called, Top Gun: Maverick.

Following the announcement, no other official announcements regarding the movie's cast or plot were shared thereafter as the actor got involved in wrapping up MI6. With no more official word available, a report by Star claims that Cruise has approached John Travolta's wife Kelly Preston to co-star in the movie. Fans would remember that Preston was Cruise's co-star in Jerry Maguire.

Bizarrely, the news report associates his request to the actress who is associated with Scientology. A source allegedly claims, ""Tom thinks she's super talented, not to mention sexy"" and wants her in the movie. But Travolta is apparently opposing Cruise's offer because the former resents the fellow Scientologist.

""John's always been jealous of the church giving Tom top billing. Tom already gets whatever he wants, but John draws the line at his wife,"" the insider said.

Meanwhile, Gossip Cop claims otherwise. The site reports that there is no tension between the two actors. The website also clarifies that Cruise hasn't even approached Preston about a role in the July 2019 release.

While fans wait to watch things unfold, Justin Marks teased the plot of the sequel. The screenwriter, who has penned down the early draft of Maverick, recently told Slash, hinting towards a love angle in the movie.

According to a May 21 report by Radar Online , Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Falchuk are planning for a baby. Paltrow, 45, already shares two children, Apple, 14, and Moses, 12, with her ex-husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. However, she’s ready to build a brand new life with Falchuk and the two are reportedly looking into the adoption process.

Sources tell the outlet that Gwyneth and Brad were exploring the possibility of IVF to conceive their own biological child, but changed their minds. The insider also claims that the pair seriously considered using a surrogate to have a child, much like Kanye West and Kim Kardashian recently did. However, after much consideration they came to the conclusion that they would like to adopt a child. Paltrow is close to Charlize Theron and Sandra Bullock, both of whom have adopted children, and they’ve given her some very inspiring food for thought when it comes to the process.

However, sources tell Gossip Cop that Gwyneth and Brad are not planning to start a family together, the actress is not pregnant nor is she considering adoption at the moment.

It's been over two years since Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton first got together, and a source close to the 41-year-old country singer tells ET that they're happier than ever!

The two were recently spotted strolling down the beach in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, and even ran into Shelton's pal, Luke Bryan. Stefani wore a white bikini top that she paired with a black sarong and a tan sweater, while Shelton sported a blue trucker hat that matched his board shorts and button-down shirt.

While they may have been an unexpected pair when they first started dating, Shelton and Stefani have been going strong for some time now.

""Gwen really loves Blake for who he is and has never once tried to change him or anything about him. She even loves his style!"" the source tells ET. ""She thinks he's such a manly man and is incredibly attracted to that about him.""

When they're not taking romantic walks along the beach, the couple often visit Shelton's house in Oklahoma along with Stefani's three sons with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma and 3-year-old Apollo. The source notes that the 48-year-old singer ""loves the influence Blake has on her kids.""

"Angelina Jolie 'missed royal wedding because her kids not invited'
(Picture: David Fisher/BAFTA/REX/Shutterstock)

The Royal Wedding was the social event of the decade, and celebrities from all over the world packed into St George’s Chapel donned in extravagant fascinators and crisp suits.

Serena William was there with her husband Alexis Ohanian and David Beckham looked dapper with his wife Victoria, whose stony expression inspired the creation of a meme. James Corden, Idris Elba, Oprah and George Clooney were also in attendance, among hundreds of stars.

Angelina Jolie however, did not attend the nuptials on 19 May.

There’s a rumour going around about why the actress decided the wedding wasn’t for her, and it’s got to do with her children.

According to a ‘source’ who spoke to Star Magazine, Jolie had been invited to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s wedding, but refused to go because her children weren’t invited.

The source allegedly told the magazine: ‘She was insulted that her kids weren’t invited. She was allowed to bring one guest – more than most people got, actually – but didn’t have a date to take.

‘In the end, she decided to skip it altogether’.

However, this doesn’t seem to be the case.

According to People, the director was seen landing in London with her kids two days prior to the wedding – but she was in England’s capital for work, not play.

Maleficent 2, for which she will be reprising her role as the wicked witch, began filming in the UK.

"Kate Hudson Net Worth
What Is Kate Hudson's Net Worth and Salary?

Kate Hudson is an American actress, producer, and entrepreneur who has a net worth of $80 million. Kate Hudson first caught the public's attention in the hit film ""Almost Famous."" Her performance was so reminiscent of her mother, Goldie Hawn's early work that just about everyone did a double take. After her star-making turn in that film, she went on to appear in a string of high-profile films, each attempting to cement her status as a romantic comedy starlet. However, this endeavor met with decidedly mixed results, and for every hit project, like ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"", there was a box office failure, such as ""The Four Feathers. After a period of downtime in late 2006, after a string of less-than-successful films and a divorce from her first husband, Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, Kate began to appear in a wider variety of projects. She seemed interested in redefining herself as something more than a pretty, funny girl and took on roles in musicals and darker projects, such as ""Nine"" and ""The Killer Inside Me."" As we detail later in this article, Kate went on to earn a fortune as one of the co-founders of the subscription fashion company Fabletics.

Early Life

Kate Hudson was born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California. Hudson is the daughter of actress Goldie Hawn and bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother. Her biological father is Bill Hudson, an actor, comedian, and musician. Her parents divorced when she was just 18 months old. She and her brother, fellow actor Oliver Hudson, were raised in Snowmass, Colorado, and Pacific Palisades, California, by her mother and Goldie's long-term boyfriend, Kurt Russell. Kate considers Russell her only father, and she has no relationship with her biological father. Hudson graduated from Crossroads College Preparatory School in Santa Monica in 1997.

Related: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner: The Way They Were Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their split after 10 years of marriage on June 30, 2015. From their first public outing, to welcoming daughters Violet and Seraphina, and son Samuel, look back at the way they were.

“Jen doesn’t want the kids around Lindsay or having her in their lives. She has many reasons,” a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.

Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, who called it quits in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.

Though the Batman star officially got together with Shookus, 38, after Garner and Affleck’s filing, a confidant previously confirmed to Us that their relationship started as early as 2014. As a result, the source notes that one of reasons the Love, Simon actress does not want the Saturday Night Live producer around her kids is “the fact that Ben had an affair with her.”

However, the exes are keeping the peace. According to the insider, “Ben understands and has honored her request.”

“They’re good friends,” the source adds. “She wants him to be honest and he usually is. She tends to find out about things, and Ben is very open with her. They both want what’s best for the kids and have made a commitment to see that through.”

While the estranged couple filed for divorce in 2017, the paperwork has yet to be finalized, partially due to Affleck’s past struggles with alcohol abuse.

"Despite Rihanna-Leonardo DiCaprio rumors, actor is single, rep says
Leonardo DiCaprio, Rihanna are seen at another birthday party -- this time hers -- fueling dating rumors.

Rihanna and Leonardo DiCaprio keep sharing birthday cake -- and we’re not even using any euphemisms right now.

The “Birthday Cake” singer and the “Wolf of Wall Street” star keep fueling dating rumors by attending the same birthday parties -- but his rep said Tuesday that he’s single and has been “for some time.”

The two were was first linked in the tabloids in January when they both hit a birthday bash at the Playboy Mansion, according to several reports. They were spotted at another birthday party at a West Hollywood hotel shortly after.

The latest b-day fiesta to kick up romantic speculation was the Barbadian beauty’s own -- her 27th -- on Feb. 21 at Jim Goldstein’s mansion in Beverly Hills. On Monday, a photo surfaced showing them together for the first time, E! News reported.

Now, we mean “together” in the loosest form of the word.

The photo, albeit extremely grainy and pretty innocuous, shows the “FourFiveSeconds” singer and the Oscar-nominated actor, side by side, lighting and holding cigarettes. Hey, it isn’t cake, but it’s the first time they’ve actually appeared with one another in a pic.

However, it also isn’t proof that they’re dating, despite what some reports have been touting.

A rep for DiCaprio told the Los Angeles Times that the actor “is single and has been for some time,” adding that he’s “been focused shooting” Oscar-winning director Alejandro G. Inarritu’s adventure drama “The Revenant” in Canada “for months.”

Still, the prospect of the power couple DiCaprio and Rihanna would comprise is pretty epic, and it has the gossips indulging in any and all are-they-or-aren’t-they morsels.

"The Weeknd Wants Babies With Selena Gomez (REPORT)
He’s got baby fever! The Weeknd reportedly wants to start a family with girlfriend Selena Gomez. According to Hollywood Life, the “Starboy” singer, 27, is hoping to welcome a baby girl with Selena, 25. (And now all we can think about is how freaking cute their child would be.)

“He has thought about starting a family with Selena at some point down the line, maybe in a few years and he has told her that he would want to have a girl because nothing would be better for him then to have a cute little Selena look-alike bouncing around,” a source told the website. “He’s mentioned to her many times that two of her would always be better than one.”

It makes sense that The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) would be thinking about babies before marriage. During a February 2017 cover story interview with GQ, the Grammy winner — who began dating Selena in January — told the magazine that becoming a dad is more important to him than tying the knot.

“I feel like I’m the kind of guy that would have kids before getting married,” the musician — who split from model Bella Hadid last November after two years of dating — explained. “The first thing would be kids. Marriage is scary to me, man.”

"Keith Urban and wife Nicole Kidman will spend Christmas in Australia
He's the New Zealand-born country music singer, who became a global superstar after relocating to Nashville.

But Keith Urban has revealed that he and his Oscar-winner wife Nicole Kidman will be coming back Down Under for Christmas.

Reported on The Daily Telegraph on Tuesday, the Grammy winner said he planned to be in Australia to spend the holidays with family ahead of his Graffiti U tour.

They'll be home for Christmas! Country music superstar Keith Urban, 50, has revealed that he and his Oscar-winner wife Nicole Kidman will be back in Australia for Christmas

'Hopefully we will come out for Christmas, hang around and then play some shows,' the 50-year-old said.

Keith said he had commitments on New Years Eve back in the US, but he would then fly to Australia for the Down Under leg of his tour.

'There is a caveat to that; I do have a New Year's Eve show in Nashville every year so many have to go back and do that before the Australian tour starts,' he said.

Land Down Under! The singer, his famous wife Nicole Kidman (above) and their two daughters Sunday Rose, 10, and Faith Margaret, 7, will travel to Australia for the holidays

The tour will start at the Newcastle Entertainment Centre on January 23, and will include two concerts in Sydney and Brisbane.

The singer will also perform one show in Canberra and one in Melbourne.

It comes after a preview was released for Keith's tell-all performance on Interview with Andrew Denton, which will air on Tuesday.

Touring again! The singer will bring his latest tour Graffiti U to Australia in January. The shows will kick-off in Newcastle with shows in Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra and Melbourne

In the preview, Keith praised his wife for staging a successful intervention for him in 2006 amid his substance abuse issues.

Soon after the couple married in 2006, Keith entered rehab for drugs and alcohol for the third and final time.

"Miranda Lambert's ACMs Speech Annoyed Gwen Stefani
It looks like Miranda Lambert and Gwen Stefani’s feud over Blake Shelton is far from over!

According to a new report, The Voice coach is ready for Blake’s ex-wife to leave his name out of her mouth after Miranda seemingly threw shade at the “Honey Bee” singer during her ACM‘s acceptance speech for Album of the Year.

MORE: Miranda Lambert Announces Her Engagement!

“Gwen thinks Miranda really needs to focus on her current relationship and not her ex. Gwen gets that Miranda’s split with Blake was heartbreaking but come on, it’s time to move on,” a source told Hollywood Life. “Gwen struggled to get over Gavin [Rossdale] but she did it and now it’s all about her relationship with Blake. None of them need to be living in the past!”

Even though Miranda has moved on with Anderson East, who accompanied her to Sunday night’s show, she still made it a point to bring up the “heartbreak” that her ex-husband caused.

“I just want to say thank you for letting me release my heartbreak and sharing it with me,” she said.

The couple announced back in July 2015 that they finalized their divorce after four years of marriage, which was right around when Gwen filed to end her marriage from the Bush front man.

It was revealed in November of that year that Gwen and Blake started dating. The “Little Red Wagon” singer moved on shortly after with Anderson — though these ladies have been at odds ever since the mother-of-three started dating her co-star.

“Miranda would welcome a showdown with Gwen, to get everything in the open once and for all,” a source previously told In Touch.

She’s also taken issue with the constant gushing Gwake does over each other in public.

“Miranda is tired of Gwen incessantly gushing about her romance with Blake,” said another source. “She’s sick to death of Blake carrying on in interviews about how Gwen ‘saved my life’ and saying he was ‘at rock bottom, in the middle of hell’ after their divorce.”

"Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus Split After a Year of Dating
Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus have broken up after over a year of dating, a source tells ET.

“They really tried to make it work and they just couldn’t right now,” the source says. “Their families came first, but ultimately having a bi-coastal relationship was difficult. They’re amicable.”

The news comes after the 46-year-old actor has been snapped two times with 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton, sparking romance rumors. On Sunday, the two were all smiles going through a Jack In the Box drive-thru in Los Angeles, and last Thursday night, they were photographed leaving Nobu Malibu together.

Another source, who is close to Sexton, tells ET that Affleck and Sexton are currently “having fun, it’s light,” noting that the couple just recently met.

ET has reached out to Affleck's rep for comment.

Meanwhile, Shookus has since deleted her Instagram account. Shookus and Affleck were last spotted together in June, when they enjoyed dinner with her parents in Santa Monica, California.

One month prior, the 38-year-old Saturday Night Live producer opened up to Elle magazine about the scrutiny their relationship faced after his split from Jennifer Garner following 10 years of marriage.

""It’s strange to me,"" Shookus said of her newfound notoriety. “My entire career has been behind the camera, and that’s definitely where I’m most comfortable. I’m a producer, I’m a mom, a friend. Being considered a public figure honestly makes me laugh.""

Meanwhile, Affleck and Garner are still legally married. The two announced their separation in 2015, and filed for divorce last April. But earlier this month, ET learned that a judge in the L.A. County Superior Court sent a document to the actress informing her that the final judgment has not been filed and entered.

"Justin Bieber Doesn't Attend Grammys 2017 and Eats Sushi Instead
Despite earning four nominations for his album Purpose, Justin Bieber had no plans to attend the Grammy awards this year. Rather than sitting at home alone, however, he decided to go out for sushi, and took fans along for the ride on his Instagram Story. (Other bystanders captured a few snaps of him walking into the restaurant as well for a full 360-degree look at what it's like to have dinner with Justin.)

Of course, this move is a statement, and not a subtle one at that. TMZ reportedly spoke to a source that said Justin ""doesn't think the Grammys are relevant or representative, especially when it comes to young singers.""

Regardless, choosing not to show up to an award show for which you have received multiple nominations, and then to highlight that fact by doing something so overtly casual is pretty suspect.

The publication’s explosive report reveals the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting her fourth child, while the Duchess of Sussex is expecting twins.

‘Meghan conceived just a few weeks after Kate,’ a source spills to In Touch, and claims that because Meghan is having multiples, ‘they’re likely to arrive earlier – which means her due date is around the same time as Kate’s.’

‘The could give birth on the same day!’ a palace insider adds.

According to the publication bombshell report, both duchesses, 36, are preparing to raise the royal cousins as part of ‘one big, happy family.’

An insider said, ‘Kate and Meghan bonded over the men they married. Now they’re bonding over being pregnant together.’

While the pregnancies are the subject of plenty of palace buzz, In Touch reveals the duchesses have only shared the news with close family and friends.

For Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an ‘enormous relief.’

‘She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,’ a palace insider says, not only because of her age but ‘because it didn’t happen with her first husband,’ producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.

"Kanye West Is Reportedly Opening a Restaurant in Calabasas and, No, It Won’t Be Serving Croissants
After years of rapping about food (most famously, demanding “hurry up with my damn croissant” on Yeezus’ “I Am a God”), Kanye West may soon be selling it. The music artist and designer has been quietly looking to expand his portfolio into food service, according to a new report that says West has been eying storefronts for a restaurant in his wife Kim Kardashian’s native neighborhood, Calabasas.

“Kanye’s shopping for the ideal premises to create a flagship restaurant in Calabasas,” a source told Radar. While the menu seemingly will not offer patrons the chance to demand their own croissants, it will be more “comfort food-oriented.” “He has this vision of creating high-end comfort food just like his mom used to make,” the source added, “but with a price tag that’s as eye-watering as it is mouth-watering, of course.” Of course.

West could always pad the menu with recipes from his wife, as she’s shared her love of cooking on social media, showing off her own fried chicken, cornbread, mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, and collard greens as part of her #SoulFoodSundays. While Kardashian received some backlash after first sharing photos from her meal back in July of 2016, she later posted testimonials from people she’s cooked for like Kevin Hart, who told her “You did that!,” and actor and TV host Terrence J, who said, “You made me a believer.” “You guys don’t understand, I’ve been making this food since high school, so when I started this post all of my high school friends were DM’ing me saying, ‘Blast from the past!,’” Kardashian explained earlier this year.

Whatever does end up on the menu, it would be shocking if it didn’t include ice cream, which is one of the few things guaranteed to make West smile. Another thing that would likely delight West is being able to design custom uniforms for his restaurant staff.

"Lindsay Lohan wears a hijab, sparking mixed feelings on social media
Lindsay Lohan was spotted at a modest fashion show wearing a hijab. The actress attended the second annual London Modest Fashion Week over the weekend, and she dressed the part.

Before the show, she posted a video on her Instagram, in which she learned how to style a hijab and expressed her desire to wear it traditionally. “I think it needs [to be] a little bit more tighter in the [back]. I don’t want it to come off and show too much,” the once risqué woman told her hijab-tutor in the video.

When someone suggested she switch wrapping styles so she could wear it as tight as she wanted, she said she wanted “to do traditional Saudi wrap. … That’s what I’d rather learn to do so I know. … I want to learn how to do it properly.” This could be because she’s set to film an all-female movie in Saudi Arabia. She then told the woman that she had been living in Dubai for three years.

She also posted a video from the fashion show and spoke to BBC Minute about modest apparel. “Fashion doesn’t always have to be so naked and can be adventurous and still beautiful, with a strong group of women behind it,” Lohan said.

Not only did she wear the right clothing, she also wore the right makeup. According to halal/vegetarian/vegan makeup retailer HawaCosmetics, Lohan stopped by their booth and told them about “how she’s into halal cosmetics and what she’s actually wearing on her face today was all halal!!” according to their social media post. They were referencing the Muslim diet and referring to avoiding non-halal makeup.

Lohan’s efforts to respect Muslim traditions are getting mixed reactions. Some people really into this look were impressed by her interest, including the designers.

9th episode of the 8th season of Friends

""The One with the Rumor"" is the ninth episode of the eighth season of the American television situation comedy Friends, which aired on NBC on November 22, 2001.[1] It continues the series' annual Thanksgiving-themed episode tradition, and guest-stars cast member Jennifer Aniston's then-husband Brad Pitt in the uncredited role of Will Colbert, who reveals that, fueled solely by his hatred of Rachel Green (Aniston), he and Ross (David Schwimmer) were part of a club in high school that spread a rumour that Rachel was a hermaphrodite.

The episode was directed by Gary Halvorson and written by Shana Goldberg-Meehan.[1] It was nominated for multiple Primetime Emmy Awards, but was criticized as ""insulting"" by a national intersex education group.

Plot [ edit ]

Monica invites an old school friend of hers and Ross' for Thanksgiving, Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). However, Will reacts very badly when learning that Rachel, who he hated in high school because of her bullying him, will be joining them for dinner. Rachel is immediately attracted to Will, unable to recognize him, but Will is openly hostile and this culminates in his proud announcement that he and Ross founded a club in high school that initiated a rumor that she was a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school. Rachel feels betrayed by Ross until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though a horrified Ross confirms it as true. Rachel demands that Ross recant the rumor by calling everyone from school, but Monica puts them both in their place by reminding them that Rachel's rumor put Ross on the social radar, that Ross and Will's rumor had no effect whatsoever on Rachel's queen bee status and that they have too much important history to fixate on the past.

"Did Kanye West Make A Diss Track About Donald Trump?
Kanye West usually loves having all the attention on him, but sometimes he just doesn’t want his name in the midst of the madness.

The G.O.O.D music CEO is being used by a rapper trying to get his come-up by bashing Donald Trump and forging Kanye’s participation in his music. TMZ reports that King Myers dropped a track called “Propaganda” and put ‘Ye’s name on it as producer. He even used Kanye’s Twitter avatar as his cover art, leading people to believe that the famous rapper had some involvement.

However, Kanye’s team is speaking out about the fraudulent project, saying that West has nothing to do with it, and he’s already put his lawyers on the job to get his name and art removed from the track.

The news of a fake Trump diss by Kanye comes just after reports that ‘Ye deleted all of his pro-Trump tweets from Twitter. Maybe he and President Trump aren’t such long-time friends after all.

An insider told Radar Online, “He’s making all kinds of deals right now that are very high stakes, and Kim’s nervous.” Although the pair already has an arrangement in place — which protects Kim from going down with him if he screws up — she “wants everything looked over with a fine-tooth comb, especially as her kids are so involved and potentially impacted at this point.” The insider added, “Kim’s worried sick about Kanye’s current situation, which has incurred millions in legal fees already and is only getting more expensive and complicated. She wants to protect herself, and for all her faults nobody could blame her.”

"Tom Cruise's secret correspondence with daughter Suri
As far as the wider world is aware, Tom Cruise has not seen his daughter, Suri, for more than five years.

The 56-year-old actor reportedly takes the estrangement to extreme lengths, not wanting to see his 12 year-old daughter on social media and very rarely mentioning her, at least publicly.

Insiders revealed to Star magazine that the reason Suri is allegedly not allowed to speak to her father publicly is that of his position in the Scientology community as well as concerns from Katie Holmes that her only daughter could become “brainwashed” by the community.

“It’s not surprising that Suri is confused by the lack of communication between her parents,” the source told the publication.

“She’s growing up, asking more questions and it’s becoming harder to shield her from the whispers. She wants to speak to her dad.”

Tom has never actually given a reason as to why he no longer sees his youngest child.

Born on April 18, 2006, Suri is the only child from TomKat’s time together.

Things could be about to change…

US OK! Magazine says the Mission Impossible actor has started to reach out to his daughter, following years of secret phone calls and “heartbreaking” letters from his little girl.

“He’s contacted Suri through a third party, who he trusts implicitly, to check in and make sure she’s OK,” an insider told OK!.

“He wants her to know that he’s thought of her all this time and got all of her messages. In fact, he read and listened to each and every word.”

“Tom’s paving the way to come back to Suri’s life permanently – and many expect it to happen soon.”

It’s unknown when Tom and Suri last saw each other.

What about the Church?

A second source has revealed to the US publication that, “Tom couldn’t reach out because Katie fled the religion.”

"Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal Dating Again
There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.

The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.

The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”

In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.

An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""

This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.

“This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.

The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""

"The real reason Mel B ended her turbulent marriage to Stephen Belafonte revealed
The real reason Mel B ended her turbulent marriage to Stephen Belafonte revealed

Sources claim the final straw for the former Spice Girl was a string of blazing rows over her £40million fortune

Just one year ago Mel B and Stephen Belafonte are ,all smiles, on the red carpet

Mel B is said to have ended her turbulent marriage to Stephen Belafonte after a “moment of clarity” as she healed a 10-year family rift and lost her dad to cancer .

‌



Sources claim the final straw for the former Spice Girl was a string of blazing rows over her £40million fortune.

‌



Insiders who worked with Mel on her US TV shows said the split was no surprise as the couple spent most of their time “squabbling” and “bickering” amid accusations of affairs and flirting.

‌



And the Mirror can reveal they spent half their marriage in therapy as they desperately tried to make things work.

A TV executive in Los Angeles said: “They started from the beginning when they realised they were very different people, who would argue and row.

‌



""Their personalities were like fire and ice, one minute it was pure adoration and the next it was all-out war.

“It led to them having blow-out arguments non-stop. However, as they got further down the line, the stress of keeping things together proved too much.

""The therapy prompted more fights and bitterness. Their connection by the end was all but burned out.”

‌



Mel, 41, fell out with her family when they told her of their concerns over ­ Belafonte ahead of their 2007 wedding.

There were fears for her three years ago when she turned up for The X Factor panel one Sunday in the UK with bruises and scratches on her face and arms. Belafonte, 41, denied assaulting her.

"Angelina Jolie Snubbed Margot Robbie Because of Brad Pitt Rumors
Looks like Margot Robbie is going to need some aloe for this burn! At the Hollywood Film Awards on Sunday, Nov. 5 in LA, Margot, 27, excitedly approached Angelina Jolie to introduce herself. But instead of a warm reply, Angie “curtly replied, ‘I know who you are’ and turned her back on Margot,” an insider exclusively tells In Touch.

According to the source, the Australian-born beauty “looked shocked.” Jealousy may be to blame. When Margot starred in 2015’s The Big Short alongside Angelina’s ex Brad Pitt, “rumors swirled about Brad crushing on Margot and that Angelina had tried to stop Brad from casting Margot in the film,” says the insider.

(Photo Credit: Splash)

The source says that the mom-of-six — who shares Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne, 9, and Knox, 9, with Brad, 53 — can’t shake her resentment toward the Suicide Squad actress. “It was clear from Angelina’s reaction to Margot that she still holds a grudge,” the source says.

Back in November 2016, not long after Angelina, 42, filed for divorce from Brad, OK! Magazine reported that the Fight Club hunk was “ready to move on” with Margot. “He thinks she’s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now,” a source said at the time. “This was a sore subject with [Angelina] who blocked them from working together a few times. Now that he’s single again, you can expect Brad to go after Margot with a passion.”

While a romance between Brad and Margot never flourished, the eternal heartthrob has recently fell for 21-year-old British actress Ella Purnell — who, in an ironic twist, played a young Angelina in 2014’s Maleficent. He’s so enchanted, a source previously told In Touch, that he cast her in his upcoming Starz series, Sweetbitter.

“Brad had Ella in mind from the get-go. He went out of his way to cast her,” said the source. “Ella is incredibly flattered by all the attention she’s getting from Brad. She’s told friends he’s always bee","1"
"Cindy Crawford
American model (born 1966)

Cynthia Ann Crawford (born February 20, 1966) is an American model. During the 1980s and 1990s, she was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers and runways, as well as fashion campaigns. She subsequently expanded into acting and business ventures.

Early life [ edit ]

Crawford was born in DeKalb, Illinois, on February 20, 1966,[2] the daughter of Daniel Kenneth Crawford and Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (née Walker).[3][4] She has two sisters, Chris and Danielle,[5] and a brother, Jeffery, who died of childhood leukemia at age 3.[6]

On social media, she stated that her family had been in the United States for generations and that her ancestry is mostly German, English and French.[7] She is a descendant of English Puritan settler Thomas Trowbridge, who helped establish the Congregational Church in New Haven.[8] She was raised in the Congregationalist faith and found it ""incredible"" that religious values ""trickled down"" to her family.[9] According to official census records, Crawford's paternal great-grandfather David Crawford was of Scottish ancestry from Northern Ireland who settled in Wisconsin.[10][11] Appearing in an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2013, she discovered that her ancestors included European nobility and that she is descended from Charlemagne.[3][12]

In her sophomore year at high school, she received a call from a local clothing store regarding modeling work, only to discover it was a prank by two of her classmates. However, the following year, another store hired a number of high school girls, including Crawford, to work for them (including a fashion shoot). In her junior year, local photographer Roger Legel, whose duties included photographing a different college girl to be that week's coed in the DeKalb Nite Weekly, asked to take her picture for the publication; the result was Crawford's first cover.[13] The photo and positive feedback she received were en","1"

Despite what you may have heard, Kourtney Kardashian is not with child.

The reality star took to Twitter on Tuesday to dispel several reports that she is pregnant, based on an interview she gave to Grazia magazine.

""The interviewer asked me 'What’s a crazy rumor that you’ve heard about yourself?' and my answer was...'I’ve heard that I am pregnant,'"" the 38-year-old mom of three tweeted. ""I see online that I said I was pregnant in an interview, but that was completely taken out of context.""

"Smiling Kanye West Celebrates 41st Birthday With Kim Kardashian and a Mentalist: Pics
Happy birthday Kanye West!

West celebrated his 41st birthday on Saturday with friends, family, music, a mind-bending mentalist and lattes that had the foam made into an image of his face because, of course.

West's wife, Kim Kardashian, shared videos and pictures from inside the amazing soiree on social media. They show a fun, festive affair, with West looking relaxed and having fun as world-class mentalist Lior Suchard completely destroyed some minds in the room with some spectacular visual illusions, suggestive powers and what looks suspiciously like some legit mind reading and telekinesis.

Suchard bent a spoon rubbing his finger on it and flipped a pair of glasses with what looked like a simple wave of his hand, delighting the ever-living heck out of West and his friends.

The party appeared to have had a cave theme, with moss hanging from the ceiling, low light and a mountain-themed birthday cake. Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner were also in attendance. West looked comfortable holding court, at one point, sitting on a couch and just taking everything in as his music played.

And then, there were those lattes with Kanye's face made into the foam.

"Katie Holmes’ trials: Fighting reports about a Jamie Foxx breakup and a Tom Cruise, Suri reunion
Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.

According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.

But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.

So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.

“Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”

At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.

“Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to wat","1"
"Kim Kardashian on Khloé Reconciling with Tristan Thompson: 'She Has to Do What Makes Her Happy'
Khloé Kardashian has put Tristan Thompson‘s cheating scandal behind her — but the drama is about to unfold on this season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

Calling into On Air with Ryan Seacrest on Thursday, Kim Kardashian West revealed that some of the aftermath will be documented on season 15, which premieres Sunday. (Khloé, 33, and Thompson, 27, welcomed their first child together, daughter True, on April 12 — just two days after allegations surfaced that he cheated on her throughout her pregnancy.)

“I don’t want to give too much away, because we genuinely had those conversations and sometimes we were filming and sometimes we weren’t,” said Kim, 37. “It was more maybe when Khloé wanted her privacy and no cameras when she was in Cleveland going through that, [but] the sisters were still all filming and talking [about] how to approach it and what to do.”

Kim admitted the situation was a first for the famous family.

“It was definitely new territory for us when you have a new baby coming into the world,” she said. “I think ultimately, we always want her to be happy, but it gets all clouded when there’s a baby, you know?”

“Her motherly instincts kicked in and she has to do what makes her happy,” she added of Khloé standing by Thompson. “So we’ll support that.”

Reflecting on Khloé going into labor in Cleveland while the rest of the family was in Los Angeles, Kim said her sister wanted to keep the news under wraps.

“[Khloé] didn’t want anyone to know she was in labor so my mom just left and got on a plane,” said Kim. “Then me and my other sisters get on another plane and we were like, ‘This is so stupid, we all need to be together and go through this!’ And it was so much drama getting there. You’ll see it all — season 15. … This season, honestly, it’s one of our best. It’s so crazy. And I’ve seen crazy.”

"An In-Depth Analysis of Jennifer Aniston's Body Language with Justin Theroux Versus Brad Pitt
In case you're still in denial, here's your weekly reminder that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are getting divorced after seven years together. And if you were—or maybe, still are—a #Brennifer fan, you'd know that Jen's relationship with Brad Pitt also ended after seven years, leaving us wondering: Is Jen a victim of the ""7-Year Itch""?

The news of both divorces shocked many fans who—based on how each couple carried themselves until the end of the relationship—didn't see it coming. Did we, by chance, miss some sort of discreet signals in their body language that would have given us reason to believe separation was imminent?

Maybe. Here, body language expert Patti Wood analyzes the nonverbal cues found in images of each couple, taken at three different phases of their relationships: the beginning, the marriage, and just before the divorce.

1998: When they first met.

When Jen and Brad went on their first date in 1998, they gave off relationship vibes via mutual touch. ""We're seeing it here, how often he had his arm around her waist, and she would reciprocate with her arm around him,"" Wood explains.

""That kind of ritualistic habit of touching each other in the same way is very comforting to your partner,"" she continues. ""It says, 'When we're out together, I'm going to always do this...I never want to be more than an arms length away.'""

One thing to keep in mind about Brad is that he is a ""C personality type,"" according to Wood. This means that his facial expressions are more subtle; he tends to smile less in photos or save his smiles for more intimate, private moments.

"‘Homecoming’: Julia Roberts Is Ready to ‘Get Started’ in First Teaser for Amazon Series (Video)
“Shall we get started?”

Amazon revealed the first teaser trailer for “Homecoming,” its upcoming psychological starring Julia Roberts, during the Prime Video panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2018 on Friday. And though it only gives us a tiny glimpse of Roberts in character as caseworker Heidi Bergman (she literally just scribbles down some notes, says the above line to someone off camera and then clicks on a tape recorder) we’re already entranced by her calm, collected mannerisms. Luckily, Amazon also revealed that you won’t have to wait much longer, as “Homecoming” will premiere this November on the streaming service.

The rest of the one-minute clip promoting the mind-bending drama directed by “Mr. Robot” creator Sam Esmail, explores the abandoned halls of what we can safely assume is the titular Homecoming Transitional Support Center where Heidi workers, a Geist Group facility helping soldiers transition back to civilian life.

Walter Cruz (Stephan James) is one of these soldiers, eager to begin the next phase of his life. Overseeing Heidi and the facility is Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), an ambitious company man whose manic demands point to questionable motives.

Four years later, Heidi has started a new life, living with her mother (Sissy Spacek) and working as a small-town waitress, when a Department of Defense auditor (Shea Whigham) comes to her with questions about why she left the Homecoming facility. Heidi begins to realize that there’s a whole other story behind the story she’s been telling herself.

Based on the popular podcast of the same name, “Homecoming” is created by Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg. Along with Roberts, the cast includes Jeremy Allen White, Alex Karpovsky and Dermot Mulroney, among others.

Seeing the couple back together in October 2017 was exciting for the majority of us that have always dreamed of their reunion… but if we’re being honest with ourselves, we always knew they’re just not good together.

Selena’s friends and family insisted on that too, and it looks like she finally listened to them because she’s ended things for good.

“Selena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship,” a source tells Us Weekly. “Like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship.

“She obviously chose happiness and her friends and family and is so thrilled about her decision-making process,” the source continues. “She feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter.”

It’s official!

Following the announcement of the birth of Prince William and Kate Middleton ’s third baby on Monday, a framed notice of the birth has gone on display on a ceremonial easel outside of Buckingham Palace.

Just as when Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born, the traditional framed bulletin was brought out of the Privy Purse Door and carried across the forecourt, to be placed on the easel in front of the Queen’s residence.

Although royal births are now announced on social media, the tradition of announcing the birth outside of Buckingham Palace on an ornate golden easel still remains.

The formal announcement includes the sex of the baby and the time of birth. It was signed at the hospital by Kate’s doctors and then taken back to the palace by car.

The royal baby’s name is typically revealed within a few days after the birth — after the Queen is informed of the parents’ choice. William and Kate waited two days before announcing both George and Charlotte’s names.

"Def Jam CEO Talks Kanye West and His New Music
Kanye West is working on new music. We got a taste of what’s coming this weekend, when two full-length tracks (featuring Migos, Young Thug, and ASAP Rocky) plus one snippet surfaced online.

In a recent appearance on Ebro in the Morning, Chance The Rappernoted that Kanye is working with Francis from Francis and the Lights on Ye’s next album. Kanye has also reportedly been working with Pusha T.

According to a previous report from TMZ, Kanye has been doing this work “holed up” somewhere in Wyoming for inspiration. But, according to a new interview with Def Jam CEO Steve Bartels, Kanye may actually be working on the new project in Utah. He's somewhere out west, it appears, but no one seems to know exactly where.

Here is the interaction between Variety and Bartels.

Variety: Let me ask what’s up with several of your artists. Word was that Kanye West was recording by himself somewhere in Utah—is that real?

Bartels: I don’t know if that’s real or not, I read the same things you do. When we talk we don’t really get down to the granular of where he’s going and how he’s flying there, we keep it much more on a broader level. Kanye is working, that’s been widely reported. He’s always very focused, and our relationship with him is that we always have great respect for him and when he’s ready to do something or talk about something, we’re there for him, we totally support his vision and his focus, and that’s where we leave it. I check in with him from time to time just to see how he’s doing. What’s great about our relationship is that I always know when it’s go time—because he wakes me up. [Laughter]

Bartels did confirm Kanye is working on new music. He was not totally sure of the timeline for the release, however.

“You never know,” Bartels said, when asked if the new music would arrive this year. “He’s always working, so maybe so. It’s never something we’re pushing—it’s always led by the creative side.”

"Liam Payne’s Solo Career Has Started With a One Direction Diss
Oh boy. Photo: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images

The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”



But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.

"‘Big Bang Theory’: Drama Behind The Scenes Not Causing Show To ‘Fall Apart’ [Debunked]
Big Bang Theory has been a staple program on CBS for over a decade now and continues to please viewers weekly. Yet recent reports have suggested that the cast members of the show are at odds and that the drama which has resulted, is causing chaos behind the scenes.

An unreliable tabloid has suggested that the main stars of the show are not happy about their pay and their air time, which is supposedly causing tensions to run high behind the scenes of the long-running sitcom.

Gossip Cop notes the details of this recent rumor that has surfaced. The said source to these claims also insists that the former relationship between stars Kaley Cuoco and Johnny Galecki has caused things to be awkward on-set.

The insider states that “The short-lived relationship antagonized star Jim Parsons and created tensions among the entire cast. Now none of them socialize together at all once the cameras stop rolling.”

Apparently there has never been a “friendly” relationship among cast members since the show aired, according to the same source, that is. However, the gossip policing site has reminded how Cuoco and Galecki are actually friendly on set since their split and joke around, as indicated by posts to social media.

“Cuoco and Galecki have remained on good terms since their 2010 split. Last year, Cuoco posted a funny Instagram photo of Galecki cuddling with her current boyfriend Karl Cook, and joked in the caption, ‘Get off my man!’ Clearly, there are no hard feelings between the exes and co-stars.”

GC has checked in with CBS sources and a trustworthy insider has relayed the story that has been circulated about supposed drama and tensions tearing the show apart is completely fake news. The stars are not battling over paychecks and in fact, made news when the top paid actors took pay cuts so that two cast members, co-stars Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch, could receive raises.

"Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi 'going to pot' to save marriage?
Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi's relationship is hanging by a thread, it has been claimed. A celebrity gossip website has come up with claims that the couple is fighting non-stop behind the closed doors.

According to Radar Online, the 59-year-old talk show host and the 44-year-old former actress recently had a massive fight during a private party held at their Hollywood Hills home. However, things cooled down after Rossi ""sneaked off to a nearby bedroom and returned with a lit joint.""

A source told the website: ""It was a very awkward night for a while. But everything got really mellow once the spliff was passed around.""

""Ellen and Portia were carrying on like a couple of happy high schoolers,"" the insider added.

DeGeneres has apparently quit drinking, which was earlier cited as reason for difference between them. The source shared: ""Ellen has always been a drinker, but she does not drink on set or when she is working. That does not seem to be their problem right now.""

DeGeneres married the Australian-American actress in 2008 at their home in Beverly Hills after the state of California lifted its ban on same-sex marriages.

The couple have repeatedly denied reports that they are trying to hide their marital problems.

Portia told ET: ""We're just really good friends and we talk about everything, and we never ever, ever lie to each other, like, not even the tiniest lies. And she's the only person I want to hang out with. Like, she is my best friend and I just want to be with her all the time.""","1"

"Sarah Jessica Parker Says 'Sex and the City 3' Fallout Was 'Enormously Painful for Me'
The cancellation of the third Sex and the City film came with headline-making allegations and jabs shared in the press between stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall — something Parker says was “enormously painful” for her.

In an interview with The Daily Beast while promoting the second season of her HBO show Divorce, the 52-year-old Emmy-winner opened up about the pains of hearing things in the press that “aren’t true” — “especially when it is a personal attack about your character.”

“I’m stunned by how deeply it still cuts,” Parker said of the drama around the movie, which would have also starred Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis. “What happened, that was enormously painful for me.”

Parker first revealed in September that SATC3 had been scrapped despite 8 years of encouragement from fans and having a “beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story” ready for filming.

Though sources told PEOPLE Cattrall made “outrageous demands” to re-board the big screen franchise, she later denied that her requests had anything to do with the scrapping of the film and claimed she had never agreed to board SATC3 in the first place — even refuting an offer to do it back in 2016.

“I never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects. To be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous,” the 61-year-old actress told Piers Morgan in October, saying Parker — who would have been a producer on the film — “could have been nicer.”

Cattrall then admitted that she had never been close with the other three co-stars. “We’ve never been friends,” Cattrall said. “We’ve been colleagues and in some way, it’s a very healthy place to be.”

"Gotti (2018 film)
2018 film by Kevin Connolly

Gotti is a 2018 American biographical crime film about New York City mobster John Gotti, directed by Kevin Connolly and written by Lem Dobbs and Leo Rossi. It stars John Travolta (who also served as one of many executive producers on the project) as Gotti, alongside his real-life wife Kelly Preston as Gotti's wife Victoria in her penultimate film.

The film was announced in 2010, but it languished in development for several years with numerous directors and actors, including Barry Levinson and Al Pacino. Principal photography finally began in July 2016 in Cincinnati, Ohio, and concluded in Brooklyn, New York in February 2017.

The film was originally set to be released in the United States on December 15, 2017, but Lionsgate, the slated distributor, sold the film back to its producers and studio, delaying its release.[5] On March 12, 2018, its new release date was announced for June 15, 2018 by SunRider Productions and Vertical Entertainment, after premiering at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.[6]

Gotti underperformed both critically and commercially; it grossed just $6 million against a $10 million production budget and was universally lambasted by critics, who criticized the writing, aesthetics, and performances of most of the cast, although Travolta's performance and the film's use of makeup received some praise.[7] It is one of the few films to hold an approval rating of 0% on the website Rotten Tomatoes.[8][9][10] At the 39th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film was nominated for six Razzies, including Worst Picture and Worst Actor for Travolta.

Plot [ edit ]

Mobster John Gotti addresses the audience, reflecting on his lengthy career in organized crime in New York City. In 1973, Aniello ""Neil"" Dellacroce, underboss to the Gambino crime family, tasks Gotti, a young associate, with killing gangster James McBratney, who is believed to have kidnapped and murdered boss Carlo Gambino's nephew Emanuel.

The newspaper — along with the New York Times, which published Pentagon Papers stories and excerpts first — faces off against a Justice Department that believes publishing the information is a national security risk, a battle that ends up in the Supreme Court.

Meryl Streep plays Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Post, whose advisors tell her not to greenlight the stories, as the resulting legal troubles could threaten the paper’s existence.

The rekindled romance between Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber has been put on pause, multiple sources exclusively tell Us Weekly.

“Selena and Justin decided to take a break mainly because of Selena’s mom and her disapproval of Justin. Justin’s family loves Selena, but Selena’s family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don’t trust Justin,” an insider tells Us Weekly exclusively. “Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed … but her family just isn’t budging right now.”

"Casey Affleck Talks #MeToo, Harassment Allegations in New Interview
Casey Affleck talked about the #MeToo movement in the actor’s first interview since resurfaced sexual harassment allegations forced him to avoid participating in this year’s Oscars.

Speaking to the Associated Press, Affleck discussed his decision to break tradition and skip this year’s Academy Awards, where – as winner of Best Actor for Manchester by the Sea the previous year – he was scheduled to present Best Actress; past winners Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence instead presented the award.

“I think it was the right thing to do just given everything that was going on in our culture at the moment,” Affleck said. “And having two incredible women go present the best actress award felt like the right thing.”

The allegations against Affleck stem from a pair of sexual harassment civil lawsuits he faced while director of the 2010 Joaquin Phoenix quasi-documentary I’m Still Here. Although Affleck denied any wrongdoing, he ultimately settled both lawsuits.

The allegations of the harassment resurfaced during Affleck’s Best Actor campaign for Manchester by the Sea; following his Oscars win, actress Brie Larson and others refused to clap for Affleck.

“First of all, that I was ever involved in a conflict that resulted in a lawsuit is something that I really regret. I wish I had found a way to resolve things in a different way. I hate that. I had never had any complaints like that made about me before in my life and it was really embarrassing and I didn’t know how to handle it and I didn’t agree with everything, the way I was being described, and the things that were said about me, but I wanted to try to make it right, so we made it right in the way that was asked at the time. And we all agreed to just try to put it behind us and move on with our lives, which I think we deserve to do, and I want to respect them as they’ve respected me and my privacy.

According to a cover story in US magazine Star today, Jen has allegedly been “caught out” planning a get together at the posh US ski destination with her ex Brad, amid the collapse of his marriage and published claims that her own union to actor Justin Theroux is supposedly on thin ice.

‘They’ve been growing closer ever since Jen reached out to Brad after his split from Ange,’ a source told Star. ‘Jen has been a real source of comfort and strength for Brad, and during their long talks, they realised just how strong their bond still is.’

The publication goes on to claim that the duo have arranged to meet up on a skiing break. While she will be accompanied by close friends, it seems there is room for Brad.

NEW YORK -- Rose McGowan's Twitter account was suspended overnight, temporarily muting a central figure in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein.

McGowan said late Wednesday that Twitter had suspended her from tweeting after the social media company said she broke its rules. On her Instagram account, McGowan said ""there are powerful forces at work"" and pleaded for others to ""be my voice.""

Twitter issued a statement late Thursday morning explaining the decision. It said McGowan's account ""was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates of our Terms of Service.""

Twitter added that the tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked.

(2004-)

Who Is Millie Bobby Brown?

Born on February 19, 2004, Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress. Her family relocated to Los Angeles, where she began earning parts on shows like Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and NCIS. Her big break came with the 2016 debut of the Netflix sleeper hit Stranger Things, on which she stars as the gifted Eleven.

Early Life & Career

Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress who was born on February 19, 2004. Her family moved back to the U.K. when Brown was four years old and then moved to Orlando, Florida, four years later to start an entrepreneurial business. It was there that she was spotted by a talent scout who told her parents ""she has instincts you cannot teach.""

Brown's parents sacrificed everything — moving their family to Los Angeles — to see Brown's acting dreams come true.

TV and Film Roles

'Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,' 'Intruders'

Within three months of moving, Brown was given the role of Alice in ABC's Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, and soon after she appeared as Madison O'Donnell in BBC America's Intruders. While Brown continued finding work in smaller roles on shows like NCIS, Modern Family and Grey’s Anatomy, she kept getting passed up for bigger roles.

With no major jump in her career, her family had become so financially strained, they moved back to the U.K. to live with an aunt. ""I was devastated. I wasn’t getting work. I thought I was done,"" said Brown in an interview with the Daily Mail.

'Stranger Things'

However, as things were looking bleak, Brown landed an audition for Netflix's Stranger Things. ""I had to cry in the audition. My emotions were so raw, I hit it out of the park,"" she said. Weeks later, Brown was on a plane to begin filming in Atlanta.

The reason: Human Rights Campaign’s Los Angeles gala dinner at JW Marriott L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles, where Perry picked up the org’s highest honor, the National Equality Award. HRC feted the 32-year-old alongside America Ferrera, 32, who took home the Ally for Equality Award, a trophy presented to her by her good friend Lena Dunham. Perry received her award from her own BFF of 11 years, actress Shannon Woodward, who said the singer “finds a way to act as an ally virtually every single time she performs or speaks publicly.”

The Russian beauty went make-up free and tied her shiny brunette locks into a laid back ponytail. Meanwhile Bradley opted to wear a grey T-shirt, tracksuit bottom and trainers. Testing out a new edgy style, the actor tied his hair into a top knot. Last week the couple confirmed their romance when they locked lips and enjoyed a major make-out session in New York as they headed out on a date.

"Everything We Know About Brad Pitt’s Plane Incident

Yesterday, multiple outlets reported that Brad Pitt is under investigation for child abuse by both the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services after an incident that occurred on his family’s private plane last Wednesday. More details have emerged about the incident that reportedly caused Angelina Jolie to file for divorce and request full custody of the couple’s six children. Us Weekly is reporting that at least part of the alleged fight was caught on film, and TMZ and People are reporting that the fight involved Pitt and Jolie’s 15-year-old son, Maddox.

According to TMZ, “the details of precisely what happened” are “murky,” but the anonymous person who reported Pitt to the DCFS alleged that Pitt “attacked” Maddox on the family’s flight home from Nice, France. From TMZ:

Here’s what’s alleged – shortly after the plane took off, Brad and Angelina began arguing and Maddox jumped up to verbally defend his mom. We’re told Brad then lunged at the boy and Angelina jumped in between them to block her husband. Brad connected in some fashion with his son.

People, which has presented Pitt’s side of the divorce story throughout the week, reports that Pitt “did not hit” Maddox during the incident. A source close to Pitt provided People with the following account:

Pitt “was drunk, and there was an argument between him and Angelina,” says the source. “There was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have.”



The source says Pitt did not hurt his son. “He is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was spiraling out of control.”

""I want to have his babies"": Kristen reveals family plans with Rob just weeks before she cheated

Kristen Stewart told a journalist from Vogue she was ready to have children with Robert Pattinson... then THOSE cheating pictures emerged

Apparently Rob likes to lick her armpits... (Image: Rex)

There are probably quite a lot of things that Kristen Stewart would like to undo after pictures showed her cheating on Robert Pattinson with a married film director.

‌



But unfortunately for Kristen, life doesn’t have the ctrl+z option so she’s stuck with any mistakes she (might) have made – and embarrassing things she might have said.

‌



Just one month before she was exposed as a cheat with Rupert Sanders, she revealed that she wants to have babies with her long-term boyfriend R-Pattz.

‌



In an un-guarded moment, she told Vogue journalist Christa D’Souza: ""My God, I'm so in love with my boyfriend. I wish he were here now. I think I want to have his babies.""

Before adding: “I love the way he smells. And him me. Like, he loves to lick under my armpits.”

While it’s ultimately quite a gross thing to say, it proves that Rob found Kristen so amazing he was happy to lick her sweaty pits. But he’s not the only person to think his Twilight co-star is, er, flawless.

‌



Rupert describes Kristen, 22, as ""amazing"" and ""flawless"" in the voiceover on the Snow White and the Huntsman DVD director's commentary.

It’s a fair assumption this was filmed before his fling with K-Stew became world (and wife Liberty Ross) knowledge.

‌



Before the affair, Rupert was asked whether Kristen and Liberty – who also featured in the movie – were friends.

No worries? The t-shirt means 'to be at total peace with yourself'

Yesterday, Kristen wore Rob's t-shirt which had the word IRIE printed on the front when she arrived in Toronto for the film festival.

"Judd Apatow slams Quentin Tarantino for Harvey silence
Judd Apatow has spoken out against Quentin Tarantino for not confronting Harvey Weinstein about his alleged mistreatment of women.

“Knew enough since Clinton was President and MC Hammer was selling millions of records. That’s a lot of years to not confront a friend,” Apatow wrote on Twitter on Thursday night.

In an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Tarantino admitted that he knew of Weinstein’s alleged mistreatment of women years ago but did not do enough to stop it.

In the interview, the director, who worked with Weinstein on basically all his major film projects, said that he’d known about Weinstein’s action as far back as the ’90s but didn’t do anything to stop it, something he admits to regretting.

“I knew enough to do more than I did,” Tarantino told the paper. “There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip. It wasn’t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things.”

Tarantino owned up to hearing directly from his ex-girlfriend Mira Sirvino and another unnamed actres about their experiences with Weinstein. He also was aware that Rose McGowan, who last week tweeted that Weinstein had raped her, had allegedly reached a legal settlement with him. Despite this, he did not realize that the incidents were part of a larger pattern.

“What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he said. “Anything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.”

Instead, Tarantino continued to work with Weinstein in the years since, including on Oscar-nominated films “Inglorious Basterds” and “Django Unchained.”

A rep for Apatow declined a request for comment, while Tarantino’s did not respond.","1"

Shepard was revered in the Hollywood and theater communities for his acting and writing. He was nominated for an acting Oscar for The Right Stuff, andhis play Buried Child won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979.

Fellow actors and playwrights posted sentiments on social media Monday, reflecting on Shepard’s impact on them and the entertainment industry.

Actor Ethan Hawke, who co-starred with Shepard in Snow Falling on Cedars (1999) and Hamlet (2000), remembered the deceased in a statement: “He was a poet of the first order. I’ve acted in many of his plays and directed “A Lie of the Mind.” He played my father twice on film. Some days he could be irascible. At other times he could be profoundly wise and kind. He was the writer any serious American actor of my generation cut their teeth on. It is a gross understatement to say, he will be missed.”

"How Meghan Markle's Uninvited Family Crashed The Royal Wedding
Meghan Markle lived out a fantasy most women could only dream of on May 19, 2018. The American actress married Prince Harry in a public ceremony in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in front of 600 guests, as well as thousands of onlookers gathered outside to catch a glimpse of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

Though the wedding was well-attended both in person and by tens of millions watching live at home, there were some glaring absences— namely, much of Markle's family. In fact, the only Markles to score invites to the royal wedding were Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, and her father, Thomas Markle. Her mom made it, but her dad was unable to attend following a series of embarrassing tabloid debacles and emergency heart surgery.

After watching the nuptials from the hospital, Thomas expressed joy for his daughter, and also nicely summed up the drama caused by his extended family.' ""Now I pray that Harry and Meghan can go on a nice honeymoon and rest and relax, and all of my relatives will just shut up about everything,"" he told TMZ. Wow! Let's jump right into that and take a closer look at how Meghan Markle's uninvited family members crashed the royal wedding.","1"

Brad Pitt is making matcha green tea on a cool morning in his old Craftsman in the Hollywood Hills, where he's lived since 1994. There have been other properties in other places—including a château in France and homes in New Orleans and New York City—but this has always been his kids' “childhood home,” he says. And even though they're not here now, he's decided it's important that he is. Today the place is deeply silent, except for the snoring of his bulldog, Jacques.

Pitt wears a flannel shirt and skinny jeans that hang loose on his frame. Invisible to the eye is that sculpted bulk we've seen on film for a quarter-century. He looks like an L.A. dad on a juice cleanse, gearing up to do house projects. On the counter sit some plated goodies from Starbucks, which he doesn't touch, and some coffee, which he does. Pitt, who exudes likability, general decency, and a sense of humor (dark and a little cockeyed), says he's really gotten into making matcha lately, something a friend introduced him to. He loves the whole ritual of it. He deliberately sprinkles some green powder in a cup with a sifter, then pours in the boiling water, whisking with a bamboo brush, until the liquid is a harlequin froth. “You're gonna love this,” he says, handing me the cup.

"Kanye ‘infuriated’ that Beyoncé and Jay-Z treat Kim Kardashian disrespectfully
Kanye ‘infuriated’ that Beyoncé and Jay-Z treat Kim Kardashian disrespectfully

Rap savant Kanye West can be, shall we say, a little temperamental sometimes. And he is particularly sensitive about how his wife, Kim Kardashian, is perceived and treated.

That said, Yeezy has had enough off the “stiff-arm” treatment that Kardashian has received from music royalty Beyoncé and, to a lesser extent, her husband Jay-Z. More specifically, according to Celebrity Insider, West is irate by the lack of respect that his former friends have for his wife.

An insider told the publication that Kanye goes “nuts” thinking about the fact that Queen Bey feels that she is far more talented and is superior to Kardashian.

This issue is really coming to light now because of the fact that Bey and Jay skipped out on Kanye and Kim K.’s wedding a few years ago – even though their names were engraved into their designated table — yet Beyoncé was able to go to Serena Williams’ wedding recently.

The source stated, “It drives Kanye insane that Beyoncé treats Kim like she is inferior and not worthy of her friendship; it infuriates him. Kanye is fiercely protective of his family and feels that by dissing Kim, he is being dissed, too.”

The family friend said West, contrary to many people, is proud of Kardashian’s accomplishments and wished Jay-Z and Beyoncé would recognize that she is a great mother and businesswoman.

The person elaborates: “As far as Kanye is concerned, Beyoncé has no right to look down her nose at Kim, sure she is a reality TV star, but she is also a wildly successful businesswoman and a self-made multi-millionaire.”

It has gotten to the point where West will only accept Jay and Bey’s friendship if they are more accommodating to his wife.

“The way Beyoncé has been toward Kim is a bone of contention for Kanye, and when it comes to any future relationship with Jay-Z, it is a real sticking point,” the","1"

The Internet Isn’t Too Happy With Vanity Fair’s Cover Story About Margot Robbie

It’s been slammed as “creepy and lecherous”–but is it really that bad?

Aussie bombshell Margot Robbie is on the cover of the August issue of Vanity Fair looking every bit the blonde goddess that she is.

However, the accompanying story, “Welcome to the Summer of Margot Robbie,” by Rich Cohen, has been widely criticized for insulting Australians and even being “creepy and lecherous.” Yikes. Well, at least no one is criticizing the stunning images that ran with it.

Looks great, right? Problem is, the accompanying article has definitely rankled a lot of folks, including Robbie’s fellow Australians:

Cohen has also been savaged on Twitter for the way he writes about Robbie, which some say overly sexualizes the admittedly very sexy Wolf of Wall Street star.

"Royal life is ruining Meghan Markle’s sexy style
Ever since she said “I do” to Prince Harry on May 19, Meghan Markle has been under pressure to adhere to royal protocol — and look good doing it.

But for the past six weeks, the new Duchess of Sussex’s fashion selections have come under fire: from her choice of sheer pantyhose to the tailoring of her dresses to her oversize pumps. Drawing particular ire was a blue and white Oscar de la Renta dress that she wore on June 17 to the wedding of Harry’s cousin. The internet caught fire with incendiary criticisms of the $5,490 frock’s too-long sleeves and ill-fitting torso.

On Twitter, it was compared to both a sack of potatoes and the “Gone With the Wind” scenes where Scarlett O’Hara fashions a dress from curtains.

The public disappointment with these perceived missteps may stem from the fact that the duchess is dealing with the pressures and expectations of her new role largely on her own.

Before the wedding, Meghan had a secret style weapon: her best friend, Jessica Mulroney. Now, it seems they’re not working together as closely, and it shows.

See Also Meghan Markle is already ditching her stuffy new royal uniform The Toronto-based professional stylist is credited with advising the then-actress on her wardrobe choices and introducing her to new designers. As a result, Meghan was praised for her casual, chic style, as she embraced hip Canadian labels such as Erdem. When she wore ripped Mother jeans, a white “boyfriend” shirt by Misha Nonoo and an Everlane tote for a date with Harry this past September, all three pieces saw an immediate sales spike.

But with Mulroney in Canada (where Meghan lived while starring in “Suits”) and the duchess, 36, in England, the new royal has been left to live up to the royal rules of decorum on her own.

"Kanye West Leaves Kim Kardashian After Massive Fight – See Details
Just when it seemed things couldn’t get any worse.…They did. Capping of a tumultuous week of bizarre rants and a Trump-related Twitter firestorm, Kanye West showed up in the TMZ newsroom on May 1 and dropped a few new bombshells. During a rambling 42-minute interview, the erratic rapper announced that he’d been hooked on opioids after liposuction in 2016 and declared that ""when you hear about slavery for 400 years…that sounds like a choice."" His shocking comments were met with instant backlash from fans, fellow celebrities and especially his own wife, Kim Kardashian.

""She’s just so mad at him for embarrassing her — and her family — over and over and over again,"" says a Kardashian source, noting that Kim is fearful about how Kanye’s behavior affects everything from their children to the Kardashians’ public image and business empire. The pair fought bitterly, adds an insider, because ""Kanye was furious that she would even try to silence him. He stormed off, leaving Kim in tears."" Now with Kanye, 40, holed up at a Wyoming resort — purportedly to work on his music — Kim, 37, is facing the fact that her third marriage is in free fall. ""She’s more humiliated than ever,"" says the source. ""Her sisters and mom, Kris Jenner, are asking her how much more of this she can take.""

She’s put up with so much already. ""Kim has tried to talk to Kanye about the effect his words are having, not only on his friends and his fans, but on those closest to him,"" says the insider, noting that she’s been living in fear for the family — including kids North, Saint, and Chicago — after rapper Daz Dillinger urged the notorious Crips gang to “f— Kanye up.”

While Kanye brushed of the danger during his TMZ rant, he and Kim did appear to beef up security, says the insider: ""They’re taking this very seriously."" All of the Kardashians are on red alert. ""This is most definitely a family crisis,"" says the insider. ""Everyone has been in","1"

Anthony Scaramucci, 53, might have found love despite losing his wife and job all in the same two-week timespan. The unemployed father of four was spotted having dinner at Trump Hotel’s BLT Prime restaurant in Washington, DC just moments after being fired, reports Raw Story. But, he wasn’t alone! Anthony was allegedly enjoying dinner with Katrina Pierson, 41, a political strategist who also appears as a contributor on CNN from time-to-time. Katrina is adamantly pro-Trump and was very briefly rumored to be replacing Anthony once he was fired, though she quickly took to Twitter to confirm that was definitely not going to happen.

According to the Daily Mail, Anthony and Katrina were with a small group of people and they chose a corner table in hopes of being secluded from the public. Anthony and Katrina were seated directly next to each other, and eyewitnesses claim that Anthony spent almost the entire meal staring at his phone instead of eating. We’re sure that he was upset about being fired, so this makes total sense. Though it’s unclear what the relationship between Anthony and Katrina is, she also took to Twitter to defend his firing by revealing he was fired at 8am that day and managed to keep the news from leaking to the press. She also didn’t hesitate to poke fun at the rumors they might be dating, though as you can see in the tweet below she doesn’t specifically address the alleged relationship:

'But when it came time to shoot, Kylie only wanted to document her business and her life on social media. She refused to talk about her dating life.'

"Quinn Perkins
Character on American television series Scandal

Fictional character

Quinn Perkins, formerly Lindsay Dwyer, is a fictional character portrayed by Katie Lowes and created by Shonda Rhimes for the political drama television series Scandal. At the beginning of the series, she is recruited to work for Olivia Pope in the Washington, D.C.–based crisis management-firm, Olivia Pope & Associates (OPA), that specializes in ""fixing"" political situations and scandals.[1]

Background [ edit ]

She lived in California under the name Lindsay Dwyer, with her mom and dad, Ray Dwyer, where she graduated from Stanford Law School. Her boyfriend, Jesse Tyler, was a computer programmer for the company Cytron. Lindsay received a text-message which she believed was from a colleague at Jesse's work who wanted to contact him. Lindsay broke up with Jesse just before he and six other co-workers at Cytron were killed in an explosion which Lindsay was framed for. She was drugged, kidnapped and taken to Washington D.C. where she was given a new identity as Quinn Perkins.

She joined a law firm in D.C. called O'Malley & Lee under her assumed identity. She was then called in to an interview by Harrison Wright to which she was hired to work at Olivia Pope & Associates.[2]

Storylines [ edit ]

Season 1 [ edit ]

Quinn gets a job at Olivia Pope & Associates after an interview with Harrison Wright, who she believed was a blind date. She is tasked by Olivia to watch Amanda Tanner at the hospital after Amanda tries to commit suicide.[2] As Olivia hires Amanda as her client, Quinn is the only one in the office allowed to help her with the case. She begins to form a relationship with a news-reporter Gideon Wallace after trying to find out what he knows about Amanda Tanner.

From there, you transition to the leg press machine , but instead of placing your feet hip-width apart, you put them close together so that your knees are touching. This instruction was a bit of red flag, because having your feet closer together can put more pressure on your joints and make it more difficult to move the weight, Stone says. ""There is no major advantage to doing the leg press with your feet together; it just works different muscle groups,"" she says. For me, it was a little too hard to successfully do the leg press with my feet together.

"Celine Dion donates concert proceeds to Vegas shooting victims
CNN —

An emotional Celine Dion returned to the stage in Las Vegas on Tuesday night, two days after the city and the country were rocked by the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.

The singer, who has had two long-running residencies in Vegas, the first in 2003, told the crowd proceeds from the night would go to the victims of Sunday’s shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival and their families.

“Tonight is very different,” Dion said ahead of her show, according to videos taken by fans. “After Sunday night’s incredibly tragic event, all of us here find ourselves asking a similar question. For you, it’s, ‘Do we still go to Celine’s show on Tuesday night, only two days after the nightmare?’ For me, it’s, ‘Can I still do my show? Should I still do my show only two days after the nightmare?’ These are difficult questions.”

Dion said she ultimately decided to go on with her performances “to show love and support for those who are affected.”

“On Sunday, we lost too many beautiful, innocent souls and so many are still suffering. But tonight, we are going to let these families know that we are supporting them and that we will help them through their tragic loss,” she said. “They are going to need a lot of love, a ton of emotional support, as well as a great deal of financial aid.”

Her announcement that proceeds would be donated drew more than 30 seconds of applause from the crowd.

Dion also dedicate the show to the victims, their families, first responders, and doctors and nurses “who are working around the clock to save lives.”

“I want you to know that you have made the right choice in being here tonight,” she said.

In the aftermath of Sunday’s shooting, which killed 58 and injured more than 500, fellow Vegas-based performer Jennifer Lopez canceled her shows through October 7, according to a statement obtained by Variety.

"When Will ‘Claws’ Season 2 Be On Hulu?
Guess what show is back? If you guessed Game of Thrones… you’re wrong! It’s Claws!

Premiering last year, the TNT dramedy takes a look at the life and crimes of a group of women who work at a South Florida nail salon. Featuring an all-star cast that includes Emmy-nominated actress Niecy Nash, Carrie Preston, and Judy Reyes, this good women gone bad comedy is a fun mix of female friendship and organized crime. Decider’s own Joe Reid called Claws one of TV’s “most unpredictable dramas” that’s both “addictive and delightful.”

When can you expect Season 2 of Claws to hit Hulu? Here’s everything you need to know!

WHAT CHANNEL DOES CLAWS COME ON?

You can catch all new episodes of Claws on TNT.

WHAT TIME DOES CLAWS COME ON? WHAT TIME IS CLAWS ON?

IS CLAWS ON HULU?

Yes! The first season of Claws is available to stream on Hulu.

WHEN WILL CLAWS SEASON 2 BE ON HULU? WHEN IS THE CLAWS SEASON 2 HULU RELEASE DATE?

*** UPDATE: Claws Season 2 lands on Hulu on Sunday, May 12. ***

No official release date for Season 2 of Claws dropping on Hulu has been announced, but we think we have a pretty good idea of when you can expect to see new episodes on the platform.

The Season 2 finale of Claws is scheduled to air on July 29th. If TNT and Hulu follow the same timetable as last year, we should expect to see Season 2 of Claws premiere on Hulu in April or May of 2019. While you wait for new episodes to drop on Hulu, Season 2 episodes of Claws are available to stream on TNT’s website.

Decider reached out to Hulu for comment and will update this story as it develops.

“RHOC has given me a great platform and I’m grateful for that,"" she shared about her exit.

Lydia McLaughlin has confirmed she will not return to The Real Housewives of Orange County. Lydia returned to the SoCal crew in Season 12 after having previously spent some time on the show back in Season 8. “RHOC has given me a great platform and I’m grateful for that. However, I feel like I can only handle this show one season at a time,” she wrote in a blog post on Friday (February 9). “I need a break! There is a lot of good that comes from the show, but also a lot of negativity. After a family vote, it was unanimous that I should take a break. Sometimes the people who love us the most see things even we don’t see. I trust my path and I’m excited for what the future holds.”

When Season 12 wrapped up, Lydia and her husband, Doug, revealed that they were mulling over plans for them to possibly expand their family with a daughter (more on that in the video below). They are already parents to three sons. In reflecting on her sophomore season on the show, she shared, ""I feel like last time I was with this group of women, I just really observed and I didnt necessarily speak my mind. And this time around, I feel like I really was able to stick up for myself and voice my opinion and I'm proud of myself for that.""

"Ben Affleck, Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus Spotted on Vacation in Maine
Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus’s summer of love continues.

The Oscar winner, 44, and his new girlfriend, 37, were spotted out on vacation in Maine over the weekend.

“He recently wrapped filming on Justice League and is enjoying his summer,” a friend of Affleck’s tells PEOPLE.

Another source adds, “He also really enjoys spending time with Lindsay. It won’t be surprising to see them out and about and together in the coming weeks.”

MEGA

The duo were spotted together on Sunday at a liquor store, where the actor posed for a picture with store employee Jenna Noyes, who posted the photo on Facebook, captioning it, “Met Ben Affleck at work today.” She has since deleted the post.

Affleck and the Saturday Night Live producer visited the same store the day before. Noyes later posted a screenshot of security footage on Twitter in another post that has since been deleted. She captioned, “The one time I don’t look up at the customer AT ALL.”

It’s not clear for whom they were buying the alcohol. In March, Affleck revealed in a Facebook post that he had completed treatment for alcohol addiction, “something I’ve dealt with in the past and will continue to confront,” he wrote.

“I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be. I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step,” the post continued.

A friend of the actor tells PEOPLE that Affleck is “committed to bettering himself and continues to stay on his path of wellness and spends time with his family.”

"The childhood hell of ‘The Lost Boys’
The day Corey Feldman met Corey Haim, when they were 14 years old and preparing to work together on the film “The Lost Boys,” they bonded instantly. Both were young Jewish actors who often competed for the same roles. They shared a first name and even a favorite number, sort of. Haim’s was 222. Feldman’s was 22.

As they spoke, it became clear that they also shared horrific histories of abuse.

Haim confided in his new friend that on the set of the 1986 film “Lucas,” “an adult male convinced him that it was perfectly normal for older men and younger boys in the business to have sexual relations, that it was what all the guys do. So they walked off to a secluded area between two trailers . . . and Haim allowed himself to be sodomized.”

Haim then followed this shocking tale with a question.

“So,” he said to his new bestie. “I guess we should play around like that, too?”

The Meal Ticket

In “Coreyography,” Feldman — one of Hollywood’s top child actors in the 1980s with hits like “Stand By Me,” “The Lost Boys,” “Gremlins” and “The Goonies” — shares tales of his own abuse at the hands of trusted adults throughout his Hollywood experience.

Along the way, he recounts his often twisted friendship with Haim — the two spent their teen years partying and living with their molesters (and no, Feldman writes, he did not take Haim up on his suggestion) — as well as his friendship with Michael Jackson, which, in a sign of how screwed up Feldman’s life was, served as one of his healthiest and most supportive relationships.

Feldman’s troubles began at home. His mother, Sheila, was a former Playboy model with severe depression and drug issues, and his father, Bob, had been in a post-hit version of ’60s one-hit wonders Strawberry Alarm Clock and only seemed to care about his son when they were getting high together.

Sheila began telling Feldman how flawed he was at age 4, when she dyed his hair blond, saying, “You were supposed to be blond.” ","0"
"Disneyland Paris Apologizes for Banning Little Boy From 'Princess for a Day' Experience
Disneyland Paris apologized after a 3-year-old was told he could not take part in a “Princess for a Day” experience just because he is a boy.

Noah, who is a super fan of Princess Elsa in the film “Frozen” was “buzzing with excitement” when he learned about the makeover opportunity at the Disneyland Hotel, the boy’s mother, Hayley McLean-Glass, wrote in an open letter on her blog. The hotel is located near the entrance of the park in the suburbs of Paris, France.

McLean-Glass, who is from Devon, England, wrote that she decided to book the experience for Noah as early Christmas gift.

“I knew that there would be NOTHING he'd love more than to get to wear a pretty dress, put make up on like Mummy does and have his photo taken being one of his beloved Disney Princesses,” she wrote.

Disneyland Paris' description of the service on its website reads: ""Grant every little girl's wish with a real Princess's make-up and hair-styling session; a fairytale transformation they'll treasure forever.""

“I was so angry, I literally couldn’t stop shaking for half an hour afterwards — I was just so shocked,” she told ITV. “I mean, I’m his mother and if I’m OK with him doing it, who are Disney to tell me that he can’t do that?”

Although Fujikawa and Hudson confirmed their relationship—with a sweet red-carpet debut—in May 2017, the pair had actually known each other for 15 years prior. Hudson told The Talk hosts that she first met Fujikawa through friends Sara and Erin Foster.



“We’ve known each other for 15 years. He’s my best friend’s stepbrother,” . “We kinda skipped through the part of knowing what the hiccups were. You kinda skip the part of going, ‘Oh, you’re like that?’ ”



She added, “In terms of family, I’ve known his family forever. To have that connection is really powerful.’

"Jim Carrey lawsuit: Unearthed note from ex-girlfriend makes shocking claims
Send this page to someone via email

The wrongful death lawsuit against Jim Carrey keeps getting uglier.

A note written by Carrey’s ex-girlfriend Cathriona White has surfaced, alleging the actor “introduced” her to multiple things, including hard drugs and prostitutes. The opposition’s lawyer has already accused Carrey of giving White three sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The letter was allegedly written in April 2013.

White intentionally overdosed on prescription medication, which was supposedly provided by Carrey. The wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey was filed by White’s estranged husband, Mark Burton, and White’s mother, Brigid Sweetman, who amalgamated their complaints into one single case.

WATCH BELOW: The latest on the Jim Carrey lawsuit

Story continues below advertisement

The body of the 30-year-old makeup artist, originally from Ireland, was discovered in her Los Angeles home in September 2015. She and Carrey, 55, met in 2012, and dated on and off.

There was some hope for a settlement out-of-court between the parties, but Burton and Sweetman’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has insisted multiple times in the past that he wants Carrey to take the stand at trial and has been demanding his deposition for months.

On Friday, Carrey filed a counter-complaint against Burton, Sweetman and White’s lawyer Filippo Machino (along with Machino’s office, The X Law Group). Carrey once again alleged that the lawsuit is an extortion attempt.

Christian Anwander Vest and trousers (part of three-piece suit, $2,675) and shirt ($395) by Dolce & Gabbana; Coupole Classic Power Reserve watch ($1,650) by Rado.

In 2017, British actor Joe Alwyn shot four films across three continents in less than twelve months, and the resulting projects, all of which hit theaters in the latter half of this year, reveal his impressive range in a series of small but critical roles. First came Operation Finale, about the hunt for Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann (Ben Kingsley), with Alwyn as Eichmann’s son. Then there was Boy Erased, a film about gay-­conversion therapy, in which Alwyn, alongside a cast including Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, and Lucas Hedges, played a closeted predator. The Favourite soon followed, a riotous period piece with Alwyn, as a besotted courtier, revealing a knack for physical comedy opposite Emma Stone.

Christian Anwander Coat ($930) by AMI Alexandre Mattiussi; turtleneck ($980) by Prada; trousers ($348) by Boss; sneakers ($180) by New Balance x Stüssy.

This month, the twenty-­seven-year-old appears in a very different kind of period film, Mary Queen of Scots. Directed by Josie Rourke, it tells the true story of two young queens who are cousins and rivals for the English crown, with a fierce and brilliant Saoirse Ronan in the role of Mary and Margot Robbie as a powerful yet vulnerable Elizabeth I. Alwyn plays Robert Dudley, Elizabeth’s right hand. “He isn’t driven by politics and ambition and power in the same way as the other male characters,” says Alwyn. “The others try to circle the women and use them for their own advantage.

"Trump Says He Was ‘Saddened’ by ‘Worst Ever’ Emmy Ratings
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has weighed in on the Emmys, which were heavy on humor and swipes at his expense.

“I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night – the worst ever. Smartest people of them all are the ‘DEPLORABLES,'” he wrote on on Tuesday night, two days after Sunday’s Primetime Emmy Awards telecast. The President is in New York, staying at Trump Tower, during the United Nations General Assembly.

I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night – the worst ever. Smartest people of them all are the ""DEPLORABLES."" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017

The Emmys, broadcast by CBS, were about on par with last year’s ceremony in terms of total viewers. Sunday’s awards ceremony averaged 11.4 million viewers, compared to 2016’s 11.3 million, its lowest ever. The telecast also averaged a 2.5 rating in adults 18-49, dropping below last year’s low point of a 2.8.

Host Stephen Colbert spent part of his monologue skewering Trump’s own fixation with the Emmys, including his past tweets that disparaged the awards handed out by the Television Academy after he failed to win any Emmy trophies for “The Apprentice.” In a tweet from 2013, Trump cited political bias for his lack of Emmy wins.

Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, criticized the “politicized” show for the “sameness” of the attacks on Trump.

“It looks like Americans are tuning out,” she said on “Fox & Friends.”

Then she addressed stars who appeared on the stage. “They want you to stick to your knitting. They want you to stick to the stuff that other people write for you.”

In 2025, Jost received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the College of Staten Island, CUNY, in recognition of his contributions to comedy, television, and community service.[8]

Early life and education [ edit ]

Jost was born on June 29, 1982, in New York City. He was raised in a Catholic household in the Grymes Hill[9] neighborhood of Staten Island.[10][11][12] His mother, Kerry J. Kelly, was the chief medical officer for the New York City Fire Department,[13] and his father, Daniel A.

"Inside Melania Trump’s complicated White House life: Separate schedule, different priorities
Donald and Melania Trump’s remarkably separate daily routines begin with him getting up around 5:30 a.m., watching cable news shows and tweeting. The first lady wakes in her own bedroom a bit later, according to two close friends of the Trumps. She then readies their 12-year-old son for school, including checking to make sure his homework is in his backpack.

Amid the noise and churn of the Trump administration — most recently about how the president paid money to silence Stormy Daniels — Melania Trump has settled into a quieter routine, often apart from the president, raising their son and carving out a place for herself in a most untraditional White House.

The first lady has not directly addressed the affairs that Daniels and another woman, Karen McDougal, said they had with her husband. But she has noticeably begun to raise her profile, independent from the president’s, and she has called a news conference in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, a public appearance that would have been almost unthinkable just a few months ago.

“Her focus all along has been children, and this launch is meant to formalize what her role will be for the next three to seven years,” said Stephanie Grisham, Melania’s spokeswoman. She said the first lady will devote the rest of the Trump presidency to the issues children face today and their well-being.

In recent weeks, the first lady has been at the center of more high-profile events than during the entire previous year — including attending the funeral of former first lady Barbara Bush solo.

Political marriages tend to be more complicated than most, but it’s striking that the Trumps make so little effort to project a more united front. Although both are keenly aware of the power of visual images, some of their memorable moments together are awkward: Melania swatting his hand away on a tarmac, and several times caught on cam","0"
"Maisie Williams Will Be a Bridesmaid at Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas’s Wedding
Looks like Maisie Williams just got another Game of Thrones supporting role—as bridesmaid to Sophie Turner at her upcoming wedding to Joe Jonas.

She let the news slip when the Radio Times asked if she was “bidding for a role.” Williams responded: “Oh, already got it. Yeah, it’s very, very exciting.”

The wedding won’t be for a while, however: Williams said that the couple is waiting until the latest season of Game of Thrones is over to start wedding planning, although she thinks Turner is “already letting her little heart wonder and imagine.” (Perhaps about how to work in some custom Louis Vuitton?)

The two actresses, who play sisters on Game of Thrones, have long maintained a close friendship offscreen. Last year, Turner gushed about Williams in an interview: “She’s my best friend, she’s my soul mate. I love that girl to pieces,” she said. They also have their own hashtag: #Mophie.

Williams won’t be the only actress to stand by her costar’s side on her big day. Courteney Cox, for example, was Jennifer Aniston’s maid of honor in her wedding to Justin Theroux, and Drew Barrymore was a bridesmaid in Cameron Diaz’s wedding. High School Musical fans got a surprise in 2014 when they noticed Vanessa Hudgens was low-key in Ashley Tisdale’s bridal party.

"Married at First Sight star who had sex 'too early' is now having a baby
The season finale of Married at First Sight had a relatively happy ending with two out of three couples opting to continue their marriages — but in a surprising twist one pair of newlyweds has revealed that they have a baby on the way.

On Tuesday night's episode of the Lifetime reality series, Jephte Pierre, 26, and his wife Shawniece Jackson, 29, made the decision to stay together just two months after they met at the altar. However, Jephte was candid about his reservations about their relationship.

'I really like Shawniece, but I don't think we had sex when I was actually emotionally ready,' he told the show's relationship experts, leaving his wife looking a bit dismayed.

Mom-to-be: Shawniece revealed she was pregnant before the finale, and she proudly showed off her baby bump in a maternity shoot

Jephte explained that he didn't want to tell Shawniece that they had sex too soon and that he 'wasn't mentally there yet' because he didn't want her to 'feel weird about it.'

'I can't remember the last time I had sex with someone I really, really cared about so I don't feel close to her because of sex,' he added. 'I don't think it will be ever because of sex that I care about Shawniece.'

After his confession, Jephte went on to lay all of his fears on the line.

'My biggest fear is that I don't fall in love with her,' he said. 'I feel like a love will have to occur but not like a passionate ""in love."" That's one of my biggest fears.'

When asked how she felt about Jephte's reservations, Shawniece admitted that it was a red flag that he might not ever love her, but she refused to dwell on it because she knew it would drive her crazy.

This just in: Some people can't take a joke, even when said joke is very clearly a joke. Kim Zolciak-Biermann, current Don't Be Tardy star and former Real Housewives of Atlanta cast member, hit up Chrissy Teigen on Twitter Wednesday with a tongue-in-cheek offer of oral sex on behalf of her 20-year-old daughter Brielle in exchange for meeting John Legend at one of his shows:

Teigen replied with a joke of her own, telling Zolciak-Biermann ""it's not that good of a show"" and that tickets could be acquired without the utilization of oral sex:

Without fail, some attempted to criticize the joke as if oral sex were actually being used as a currency:

BRB. I need to take a sighing break.

For the record, Brielle is cool with the joke:

And she isn't a fan of some publications' coverage methods:

Zolciak-Biermann later toldTMZ that anyone who regularly pays attention to her account would know that's simply her ""sense of humor."" She also had a message for those still up in arms about the tweet: ""If you can't take a joke, feel free to unfollow,"" she said Thursday.

"Selena Gomez Is Going To Keep Her Blonde Hair
Selena Gomez is going through a bit of a reinvention right now. She's back together with ex Justin Bieber; she's been putting out new music; and, most recently, she dyed her signature dark hair platinum blonde. And, according to the singer herself, it doesn't seem like her metamorphosis is going to stop any time soon.

After Selena debuted the stunning new look at the American Music Awards last month, E! News asked the ""Wolves"" songstress if the blonde dye was here to stay. ""She's not going anywhere,"" she replied, referring to her (apparently female-identifying) strands. Selena added that she's ""still getting to know"" her new 'do. It's especially wise of her to keep the dye job a little bit longer, seeing as it took so long to achieve the jaw-dropping look in the first place. In a recent Instagram post, Selena's colorists, Nikki Lee and Riawna Capri, called the color ""Nirvana Blonde"" and revealed that the transformation took a whopping nine hours.

Selena has clearly been having fun with her makeover: She added rainbow bangs to her look last week to complement the Minnie Mouse ears she stole from her little sister, and she recently rocked a two-tone updo with a bright yellow dress. Clearly, Sel has come a long way since that mid-2000s hair phase that included chunky blonde highlights and extensions.

Hair aside, Selena has been having an overall incredible year. Besides the aforementioned changes, she also went through life-saving kidney transplant surgery and claimed the title of most-followed person on Instagram, scoring half of the top-10 most-liked pictures of the year on the social media app. She's so influential, she recently told Billboard that Kevin Systrom, the co-founder of Instagram, gets mad at her when she doesn't post for a while. Uh, same. More hair pics, Selena!

"Delilah Opens Up About Son's Suicide and Heartbreaking Goodbye Note
The velvety voice of Delilah Rene Luke is known far and wide for offering life-learned advice to her 8.3 million late-night listeners, but now the popular syndicated romance radio star is the one in need of support following the shattering death of her teenage son Zachariah to suicide on Oct. 3.

Speaking out for the first time since sharing the news on Facebook, the mom of 13 opens up to PEOPLE in this week’s issue, offering details of 18-year-old Zack’s life and recent struggle with depression in hopes of raising awareness for other family’s at risk.

“He was my wild child; 13 broken bones, umpteen trips to the hospital with appendicitis, tonsillitis, a fractured skull. He was wild but so so so sweet,” the Port Orchard, Washington-based star, 57, recalls of raising son Zack (one of her three biological children, the other 10 were welcomed through adoption).

And like his mom, Zack, who was a senior in high school, had the gift of compassion. “He was a faithful friend to the outcast and the troubled. Dozens of his friends have written to me and told me he was like a counselor to them,” says Delilah, adding that in the wake of his death, the mom of one of his friends reached out saying “he saved her daughter’s life when she was battling depression and anorexia, insisting the girl tell her folks and going with her to do that.”

His own struggle began recently, following a December 2016 car accident. “The event traumatized him,” she says. A painful breakup and an illness followed suit and soon Zack found himself behind in school.

“When he found out he wouldn’t graduate he spiraled into depression, and was honest about it,” says his mom, who quickly “found him doctors, a fabulous counselor and support group.”

"The Dos and Don’ts of Wearing Yoga Pants Around Town
“Yoga pants should be illegal in public anyway,” Moore told the Associated Press. “I want Montana to be known as a decent state.”

[ How to Master the Athleisure Trend Like Gigi Hadid ]

Despite Moore’s loony war on yoga pants, U.S. sales for yoga clothes have increased 45 percent year over year. At the same time, participation in the sport only increased 4.5 percent, which means that more and more women are adopting athleisure wear into their daily uniform. And why not? They’re versatile, seasonless and most of all, comfortable. But that doesn’t mean we can all wear them willy-nilly. There’s a time and a place for everything.

Need a review? Here are the dos and don’ts on how to wear yoga pants around town without getting the side-eye.

DO: Learn from Lululemon’s sheer pants recall. Make sure you select a pair that is truly opaque. Test them out in broad daylight or under bright lights.

DON’T: Wear them to work. Ever. “Dress Pant Yoga Pants” is an oxymoron.

DO: Invest in the correct size. It sounds like a no-brainer, but often women will purchase a size down to get a tighter fit or a longer shelf life since yoga pants stretch out. In reality, all you end up with is “camel toe.” Avoid at all costs.

DON’T: Show your panty lines. If thongs aren’t your thing, Commando and Zobha make great full-coverage bikini bottoms that are undetectable.

DO: Layer up! Throwing on a leather jacket or a dark trench over your yoga pants and T-shirt will instantly dress up your look when you’re running from bikram to brunch.

DON’T: Keep wearing your favorite pair after the expiration date. Unlike jeans, yoga pants don’t age well. Toss them when they’re overly faded, stretched or ripped.

DO: Accessorize! Nothing pulls together athleisure wear like a statement handbag and a pair of sunglasses.

DON’T: Try to pull off your zaniest tie-dye yoga pants outside your ashtanga class. Stock up on neutral colors — navy, black, charcoal — th","0"

The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story actor, 30, announced their engagement news on Instagram and Twitter Friday evening. “Mia and I have had seven and a half years of fun, wacky, wonderful, CRAZY adventures together,” Criss wrote along with a photo of the happy couple.

“And I’m happy to announce that we’re kicking those adventures up a notch. We’re goin for it. To boldly go where neither of us have gone before. Engage,” the former Glee star added.

Though the date of the proposal is unknown, Criss and Swier, 32, last attended the Los Angeles premiere of the FX series in Hollywood together on Jan. 8 when the writer and producer was spotted without an engagement ring on that finger.

“Oh yeah, we’ve been together a long time,” Criss said in a 2013 interview when asked about Swier. “I didn’t know I was going to be on TV when we started dating.”

Swier attended New York University’s Steinhardt School of Media Studies and Television Production, and has worked for networks such as Fox and Showtime.

"Goldie Hawn Shocks Amy Schumer, Ellen DeGeneres During ‘Never Have I Ever’ Game (Video)
Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn played a round of “Never Have I Ever” with Ellen DeGeneres on Thursday, and Hawn surprisingly won the round with the most “I have” revelations.

The on-screen mother-daughter duo stopped by to promote their upcoming film, “Snatched.” DeGeneres first asked them, “Never have I ever taken a naked selfie,” to which both actresses raised the “I have” paddle. But Hawn soon revealed it was actually her partner Kurt Russell who took the photo of her naked as she was pretending she “was a strong man.”

DeGeneres also asked about whether they had a tattoo that they regret, something Schumer has been vocal about in the past — she even wrote a book titled “The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo.”

The big shocker came when DeGeneres asked, “Never have I ever been caught by the police having sex,” to which Hawn revealed that she had. But once again, it was Russell’s fault.

“Do I win?” Hawn asked, to which Schumer responded, “you’re winning!”

“Snatched” stars Hawn and Schumer as a mother and daughter who go on vacation to Ecuador but soon get kidnapped and the pair have to find a way out of their unexpected situation. Ike Barinholtz, Wanda Sykes and Joan Cusack also star.

“Snatched,” marking Hawn’s return to the big screen after 15 years, hits theaters tomorrow.

"Michelle Tanner
Fictional character from Full House

Fictional character

Michelle Elizabeth Tanner is a fictional character on the long-running ABC sitcom Full House, who was portrayed by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. She first appeared in the show's 1987 pilot, ""Our Very First Show"", and continued to appear up to the two-part series finale, ""Michelle Rides Again"", in 1995. The character of Michelle was the Olsen twins' first acting role; the two were nine months old when they started working on the series. Shortly after Full House ended, the sisters appeared in many films and TV shows up until their teenage years. Michelle Tanner does not appear in the 2016 Netflix sequel, Fuller House, as both Olsen twins declined to reprise the role.

Character [ edit ]

Michelle Tanner is the youngest member of the Tanner family and is notable in the series for saying a string of precocious catchphrases such as ""you got it dude"", ""puh-lease"", ""you're in big trouble, mister"", ""no way, José!"", and ""aw nuts!"" Raised by her father Danny Tanner, her uncle Jesse Katsopolis and her father's friend Joey Gladstone after her mother Pamela's death in a car accident caused by a drunk driver, Michelle debuted during her character's infancy, maturing throughout the progression of the series. She is depicted as being slightly mischievous, though her status as the youngest daughter of the family leaves many of her misdeeds undisciplined and spares her from punishment – much to the chagrin of her older sisters. Michelle is quite playful, being a young child; however many episodes end with her realization of a vital moral. Having never interacted with her deceased mother, Michelle occasionally yearns for a mother of her own and episode plots have surrounded her desire for a mother and her plans to attempt to gain one through her father Danny remarrying. She forms a very strong familial bond with Jesse (her uncle) and enjoys his company and playful teasing. She was the flower girl at his and Becky'","0"

"Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee React to Zero Grammy Wins for 'Despacito'
Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee nabbed big nominations at Sunday’s 60th Annual Grammy Awards with their record-breaking hit “Despacito.” The track got nods in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, Record of the Year and Song of the Year categories and if it had won in the either of the latter two categories, it would’ve made history as the first Spanish-language song to do so. With Bruno Mars sweeping the major categories, Fonsi and Yankee weren’t able to make that historic stride forward, but the Puerto Rican artists remained positive.

“We’re not leaving empty-handed tonight,” wrote Fonsi on Instagram following the award show. “To be able to break the language barrier and unite the world with a song is the best prize anyone can win. Let’s continue sharing our culture and our Latin music with the entire world. Thanks for supporting us, this is just the beginning.”

Yankee shared the same image, writing, “Thanks to all #latinos for coming together to see us shine at the #grammys.”

For Fonsi, the Grammy nod — and potential win — was all about celebrating his Latin heritage and pride. Before the ceremony, he spoke to ET about what the evening meant to him. “This is really big,” he said. “Not only for me, but for Latin music in general, to be able to sing a song in Spanish for the big show. I’m really proud to be here. Being from Puerto Rico, growing up here in the United States, I’ve always been so proud of my roots and my language, and all these artists who are performing, they’ve all influenced me. So to be able to celebrate a little bit of who I am and where I’m from, and to share with the world, and break that language barrier — especially after everything that [Puerto Rico has] been going through.”

Although the two artists kept their post-Grammy messages positive, some celebs and fans felt the duo were robbed, including Perez Hilton and Frankie Grande, the b","0"

While Kendall Jenner might be on a mission to make her niece, North West, into the next Nobel Prize-winning feminist scientist, having gifted the four-year-old a science craft book for her recent birthday, it seems her sister Kylie is wanting to pay homage to another leading lady in her life – her 'momager' Kris Jenner.

"Nikki Bella and John Cena Are Officially Back Together — Six Weeks After Calling Off Wedding
Nikki Bella and John Cena have rekindled their relationship.

More than a month after the pair ended their engagement in mid-April — just three weeks before their destination wedding — a source confirms to PEOPLE that the couple is officially back together.

“They were always going to find their way back to each other,” says the source. “It was never going to be permanent.”

In the time since Bella, 34, called off their wedding — a decision that she was “heartbroken” about — the two wrestlers have been on the road to reconciliation.

Following their breakup, both the Total Bellas star and pro-wrestler have been open about their desire to get back together. Bella previously told PEOPLE that she’s been in “communication” with the pro wrestler and that they were taking steps to get back together.

On May 19, the two were spotted out together for the first since their split.

“They’re basically back together,” a second source close to the situation told PEOPLE at the time. “They never stopped talking. Other than the actual wedding weekend, when they took some space, they have been talking.”

WATCH: Nikki Bella Wishes John Cena Would’ve Called Instead Of Discussing Breakup On ‘The Today Show’

Sources had previously said that her decision to call it quits was due to their differing stances on marriage and having kids: She wanted a family, but Cena, 41, was hesitant.

“This was never really about ending their relationship — it was about calling off a wedding because something didn’t feel right,” an insider said. “It was a wedding that was entered into under false pretenses. She was pretending she was okay with not having a kid, he was pretending he absolutely couldn’t and wouldn’t budge on that point.”

“They both got a wake-up call once they canceled the wedding, and they both realized they could fix what was broken,” the insider added.

Kimberly J. Brown, who played heroine Marnie Piper in the first three Halloweentown movies (we do NOT talk about the fourth film), finally confirmed fans' suspicions that she and her Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge co-star, Daniel Kountz, were more than just friends.

For International Kissing Day on Saturday (July 6), Kimberly posted a kiss pic that would make Kalabar's jaw drop. ""#internationalkissingday you say? I’ll just leave this right here then 😏,"" she captioned.

OMG. I ship it so hard. Seriously, they're both so dang cute!

Daniel has been popping up on Kimberly's Instagram more frequently over the past few months. For Halloween last year, they did a couples costume as superheroes. A few months later, they spent Christmas Eve together.

They've hung out in Portland, saw Hamilton, and more recently, attended The Big Bang Theory star Kaley Cuoco's wedding.

Back in 2016, fans first started noticing the DCOM stars had reconnected when Daniel appeared in Kimberly's hilarious short about what really happened to Kal at the end of Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge. (Spoiler: He went to magic rehab.)

A year later, the duo acted onscreen together again in another short that's partly Not Safe for Disney.

You don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to crack this love mystery, but neither Kimberly nor Daniel confirmed they were more than friends — until that glorious pic dropped.

May 31 (UPI) -- Amber Heard is getting to know new beau Elon Musk's five kids.

The 31-year-old actress spent some quality time with the 45-year-old Tesla founder and his sons Tuesday at Sydney Opera House in Australia.

""Kidding around,"" she captioned a series of photos from the outing on Instagram.

Musk shares twins Griffin and Xavier and triplets Damian, Kai and Saxon with first wife Justine Musk. He and Heard were first linked in 2016 after splitting from their respective spouses, Talulah Riley and Johnny Depp.

""Sydney is such a beautiful city,"" the entrepreneur captioned a picture of himself with Heard and one of his sons.

Heard and Musk were all smiles during a date night Sunday in Sydney. Sources told People this month that the Tesla founder has seemed ""noticeably happier"" since he started dating Heard.

"Bill Cosby found guilty of sexual assault in retrial
NORRISTOWN, Pa. — Bill Cosby, who once embodied the idealized American father on a wildly popular sitcom, was convicted of sexual assault on Thursday in a high-stakes retrial after a half-dozen women testified that the famed comedian drugged and assaulted them.

The jury found Cosby, 80, guilty on all three counts of aggravated indecent assault against one woman, Andrea Constand, 45, drawing an emotional reaction from his other accusers in the courtroom.

The verdict was one of the first major courtroom victories for the #MeToo movement, which has exposed sexual harassment and misconduct in entertainment, media, politics and beyond.

Upon the reading of the first guilty verdict, several of Cosby's accusers sobbed and shook with joy. Cosby's head was bent slightly, eyes shut.

Although Cosby has faced dozens of sexual misconduct allegations spanning decades, he has been charged criminally only in the Constand case. Constand, a former employee at Temple University in Philadelphia, testified that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his suburban Philadelphia home in January 2004.

Constand maintained her composure as the verdict was read in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.

Cosby lashed out at prosecutors as they asked Judge Steven O'Neill to revoke his bail, suggesting that he was a flight risk.

Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele noted Cosby's wealth and said he had a plane.

""He doesn't have a plane, you asshole! I'm sick of it, you asshole!"" Cosby exclaimed.

Cosby faces a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $25,000 on each count. He remains free on bail until sentencing. But he is unlikely to spend much time in jail.

O'Neill said that because of Cosby's age and his medical condition — his eyesight is poor — ""I am not going to simply lock him up."" Cosby has to surrender his passport and must remain in his nearby home, the judge said.

The Kardashian-Jenner’s Easter bash, complete with a 10-foot Easter bunny made of flowers, as well as a petting zoo featuring baby ducks and rabbits, comes shortly after Jenner’s ex-boyfriend Tyga denied that he was Stormi’s father.

“I’ve never said anything about someone else’s child or family insinuating my involvement; and will never do so,” Tyga tweeted on Tuesday.

“Please, stop spreading false stories and attacking people’s families. I have nothing to do with any of that.

"Woody Allen: 'I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement'
Woody Allen has spoken about his support for the #MeToo movement, saying that he should be “the poster boy”.

In an interview on Argentinian news program Periodismo Para Todos, the writer-director was asked if there was any truth behind the allegation that he sexually abused his daughter, Dylan Farrow.

“Of course not, this is just so crazy,” he said. “This is something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue. And that was the end and I’ve gone on with my life. For it to come back now, it’s a terrible thing to accuse a person of. I’m a man with a family and my own children.”

The story was resurfaced after allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein and other key figures in Hollywood of sexually predatory behavior. It led to many actors talking about their regret over working with Allen, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Ellen Page.

“Everyone wants justice to be done,” Allen said. “If there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that’s a good thing.”

But the 82-year-old is frustrated that his name has been used alongside the men accused of misconduct. He said that the people who have been accused by multiple women shouldn’t be equated with him, as he was “only accused by one woman in a child custody case” and believes he should be heralded as an important ally.

“As I say, I’m a big advocate of the #MeToo movement,” he said. “I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it’s a good thing that they’re exposing them. But you know I, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. Because I have worked in movies for 50 years.

Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage — and seven years as a couple.

“In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,” says a statement released by longtime Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.

“Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. ”

The couple announced that they split at the end of the last year, however, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.

The two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months raising questions. Theroux was often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home.

"Kristen Bell Praises Dax Shepard on His ‘Sobriety Birthday’: ‘I Am in Awe of Your Dedication’
Kristen Bell gushes praise in the most heartfelt and funny way Saturday in tribute to her husband Dax Shepard, who is celebrating his “14th year sobriety birthday.”

“I will forever be in awe of your dedication, and the level of fierce moral inventory you perform on yourself, like an emotional surgery, every single night,” the “Good Place” star wrote in a touching Instagram post to her husband of nearly eight years.

Along with a series of photos of Shepard with their babies, Bell posted what began as a light-hearted ribbing, teasing the man “who wore baby Bjorn for 2 straight years to show his girls how to be as adventurous as possible.” Her joking turned to praise and adoration for his struggle well-fought (and continues to fight).

“I know how much you loved using. I know how much it got in your way,” she wrote. “And I know, because I saw, how hard you worked to live without it.”

Here’s her entire tribute:

“To the man mocked me when in our wedding photos because I cried too many tears of joy, Who wore a baby Bjorn for 2 straight years to show his girls how to be as adventurous as possible, who held our dear little shakey mann pup for 8 hrs straight on the day we had to put him down, I know how much you loved using. I know how much it got in your way. And I know, because I saw, how hard you worked to live without it.

I will forever be in awe of your dedication, and the level of fierce moral inventory you perform on yourself, like an emotional surgery, every single night.

You never fail to make amends, or say sorry when its needed. You are always available to guide me, and all of our friends, with open ears and tough love when its needed most.

You have become the fertilizer in the garden of our life, encouraging everyone to grow. I’m so proud that you have never been ashamed of your story, but instead shared it widely, with the hope it might inspire someone else to be","0"
"13 Reasons Why: Katherine Langford says goodbye to Hannah Baker
This post contains spoilers from season 2 of 13 Reasons Why.

Season 1 of 13 Reasons Why was the story of Hannah Baker’s death. Season 2 was the story of letting her go. And if there is a third season, well, Hannah Baker — and more specifically, Katherine Langford — won’t be returning. Which means that, while all of the characters within the fictional world of 13 Reasons were saying goodbye to Hannah during season two, Langford was doing the same.

EW spoke with Langford about what it was like to bid farewell to her first role.

ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Did you know at the start of season 2 that this was your chance to say goodbye to this character?

KATHERINE LANGFORD: In all honesty, no. I think [showrunner] Brian’s [Yorkey] always had an idea about how many episodes that I would be in, but this season was interesting because unlike last season, it was completely new territory. We weren’t based on a book. And particularly for Hannah, it was something that was developed over the course of shooting, but I think that ultimately it was important to have her back for a second season and assist in continuing the dialogue from season 1 and following a lot of the other characters this season, particularly Clay.

This year, you were playing Hannah… but not really. How did you find that balance between the character we knew and how others saw her?

Season 1 was something that I could really sink my teeth into and pour myself into the character, whereas this season was challenging as an actor because I had to put a lot of faith and a lot of trust into the writers and the directors in making sure that what I was doing was right and their vision. I think what everyone learned over the course of shooting and developing her was that you don’t see the same Hannah this season, and that’s for a number of reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is that every time we see Hannah this season, it’s either through flashbacks or","0"
"Johnny Depp Sued by Ex-Bodyguards for Unsafe Working Conditions and Unpaid Wages
Johnny Depp is facing a new lawsuit filed by two former bodyguards, who are suing the Pirates of the Caribbean star for unpaid wages, wrongful termination and unlawful business practices, among numerous other allegations.

In documents obtained by ET, private security professionals Eugene Arreola and Miguel Sanchez say the were employees of the private security firm Premiere Group International and claim they were assigned to protect Depp.

When the 54-year-old actor faced a ""financial crisis"" in 2016, Depp cut ties with the company, but hired both Arreola and Sanchez individually, according to the lawsuit. They claim that they were ""told they would be classified as ""employees,"" and would receive all the protections and benefits they were entitled to under the law.""

The bodyguards -- who claim that they formed close friendships with Depp's family and friends during their years guarding the movie star -- allege that, between 2016 and 2018, ""things began to spiral toward chaos,"" and that they ""found themselves in situations that required more than what a bodyguard would be expected to do.""

The lawsuit alleges that the bodyguards were ""asked repeatedly to drive vehicles that contained illegal substances, open containers and minors"" and were ""asked to monitor unstable individuals in [Depp's] life and entourage.""

The suit further alleges that Arreola and Sanchez were ""forced to protect [Depp] from himself and his vices while in public, becoming caretakers for him.""

Additionally, the bodyguards claim that they were ""exposed to unsafe conditions and situations"" and, as a result, they suffered ""stress-related injuries created by a hostile and unsafe work environment.""

Arreola and Sanchez also claim that, for nearly two years, neither of them were paid overtime wages, despite working 12-hour shifts. They also claim that they were not given their legally mandated meal and rest breaks.

Will Tristan be in it?), but the main one that has us HYPED is that potentially both Khloé and Kylie will debut their baby bumps.

"Robert De Niro yells ‘F**k Trump’ twice at Tony Awards, receives standing ovation - National
Send this page to someone via email

With a bleep on live television and double fists raised in the air, Robert De Niro got the theatre crowd on its feet at the Tony Awards with a rousing political introduction of his old friend Bruce Springsteen that was focused squarely elsewhere: on U.S. President Donald Trump.

De Niro, a staunch Trump opponent, dropped a couple of F-bombs heard clearly by the Radio City Music crowd Sunday night. The CBS television audience heard dead silence instead before he raised his arms — twice — and earned a sustained standing ovation.

The legendary actor urged the audience to vote in November and lauded Springsteen for his own political commitment before the singer sat at a piano for a moving performance based on his “Springsteen on Broadway” show that had him singing his classic hit, “My Hometown.”

"Writer Jenny Lumet: Russell Simmons Sexually Violated Me (Guest Column)
Russell Simmons, a prolific music and TV producer and co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, was accused of sexual assault and harassment by model Keri Claussen Khalighi in a Nov. 19 article in the Los Angeles Times. Simmons then denied the incident in a letter published Nov. 22 by The Hollywood Reporter. The letter prompted Jenny Lumet — an award-winning screenwriter (Rachel Getting Married, The Mummy), the daughter of filmmaker Sidney Lumet, and granddaughter of singer/activist Lena Horne — to pen a response detailing her own experience with Simmons.

On Nov. 22, 2017, Russell Simmons wrote:

“I have never committed any acts of aggression or violence in my life. I would never knowingly cause fear or harm to anyone.”

Dear Russell:

I met you around 1987, through Rick Rubin, who has always been kind to me. Rick knew my sister through NYU and asked me, at the upstairs bar in a nightclub called the Palladium, to be in a movie you were producing that Rick was directing, starring RUN DMC. It was, frankly, a lousy movie, and I was terrible in it.

Over the next three or four years, I would see you out and about, at a nightclub called Nell’s mostly. I don’t recall you and I ever just going out to dinner, or having a one-to-one experience; we were always in groups, and we had many, many mutual friends. You were charming and funny and charismatic and self-deprecating. Not being in the music business made it possible for me to relax around you. And you were a fan of my grandmother, respected her, and told me so. You seemed sincere.

You pursued me, lightly, on and off, over a course of years, saying you had a thing for a “little yellow girl” (me). I rebuffed. It wasn’t deep, as far as I knew. It was never a big deal. You had, I assumed, many women in your orbit.

Once you sent me 250 balloons with the note “Please baby, please baby, baby, baby, baby” after a character in a Spike Lee movie. It was light, fun ","0"
"Kardashians Diet: Salad on Keeping Up With the Kardashians
There's no lack of information on the Kardashians out there. Open up any of your social media apps and chances are you'll see their famous last name plastered in a headline. But while everyone focuses on Kim's new book of selfies, Selfish, or Kylie's lip-gate, we have more pressing intel on something that the fans really want to know: What is that salad the Kardashians are always eating on Keeping Up With the Kardashians?!

We have the answer: The Kardashian clan chomps on two different salads from a little shop called Health Nut in Woodland Hills, Calif. (just on the border of Calabasas, where they live). One is a simple Chef Salad with chicken, romaine and iceberg lettuce, shredded mozzarella, tomatoes, sprouts, and sunflower seeds, while the other is a Chinese Chicken Salad with chow mein noodles, pickled ginger, and carrots on romaine and iceberg lettuce.

"Dame Helen Mirren reveals her new ad campaign as she explains how she does it
When I revealed in this column last year that Dame Helen Mirren was the new face of L’Oreal, I had hundreds of letters from readers, ecstatic that beauty giants are celebrating older women.

As these exclusive pictures show, from next week (February 5) Helen will be appearing in her first television advertising campaign for the company.

The 69-year-old actress will be seen championing the role of the older woman — and the candid, unretouched shots from the advert show that wrinkles, ageing hands and natural make-up can be beautiful.

I suspect this approach will sell more products than the glossier, airbrushed campaigns that many women feel don’t relate to them and their real lives.

During the filming of the advert, Dame Helen took time out to speak exclusively to us about what she really thinks about beauty — and reveals she doesn’t even like the word!

She told us: ‘I used to worry a lot more about my looks than I do now.

‘I think the great advantage of getting older is that you let go of certain things. Having said that, I think all women worry to some degree — and I don’t think men are exempt.

‘I don’t really like the word “beauty”. There are physically beautiful people in the world (David Beckham, for instance, is unbelievably beautiful), then there are other people that are not beautiful, but are very attractive because of their personality, energy, brilliance, genius: all kinds of things.

Gal Gadot had an incredible 2017. Gal Gadot had an incredible 2017.

Gal Gadot is really the Hollywood find of 2017. She did appear in a few films before, including a brief appearance in Batman v Superman, but it was in 2017 that she shone. Gal has in a minuscule amount of time risen to become one of the top most actors in Hollywood. Her performance in this summer’s DC blockbuster Wonder Woman helped DC’s cinematic universe get on track and she was adored even in Justice League, which was a failure for Warner Bros and DC. She did only two films this year, but since those films came from a big studio like Warner Bros and were superhero movies that usually earn big bucks, they helped her to become the highest paid actress of 2017, according to Forbes. Oh, and she was pregnant while filming many of her stunts in Justice League. Isn’t she really the Wonder Woman?

Meanwhile, the gorgeous Israeli actor took to social media to reminisce the last year and posted a collage to give her fans glimpses of top moments of the year for her. The first photo is of The Hollywood Reporter’s cover with a photo of she and Wonder Woman’s director Patty Jenkins.

So many moms can relate to this.

Jessica Alba, the 36-year-old actress and entrepreneur, was out shopping with newborn son Hayes at Target on Friday when her baby need to breastfeed. Looking for a spot, Alba took to a fitting room.

Sharing the very real motherhood moment on Instagram, the actress and Honest Company co-founder captioned a selfie of her and newborn, writing: “Tired eyes,” and “Breastfeeding in a Target dressing room.”

Target has a mommy-friendly breastfeeding policy that reads supports nursing ""in any area of our stores, including our fitting rooms, even if others are waiting."" It's also been reported that Target has been testing out designated nursing stations at some locations. That's something we'd love to see more of!

The ""Dark Angel"" actress has been outspoken and proud about breastfeeding her 7-week-old, sharing updates on social media before the Golden Globes, while watching Netflix and even after going to the spa.

Hayes, born on New Year’s Eve, is Alba’s third child with husband Cash Warren, joining daughters Honor Marie, 9, and Haven Garner, 6.

Despite all of her successes, Alba still feels all of the typical pressures of motherhood, impromptu nursing breaks included.

“Any mom who all of the sudden has little people that rely heavily on them for survival needs to maintain her own sense of self,” Alba told TODAY. “You need to cut yourself some slack and bite off what you can chew. Things will be compromised and you just have to be okay with that.”

"What Is Dwyane Wade's Net Worth?
He's one of the best players in basketball, so what is Dwyane Wade's net worth?

Just how much money can a basketball superstar be worth? Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade's net worth is estimated to be over $100 million from more than a decade of lucrative basketball contracts and athletic gear sponsorships. Wade has also taken some interesting risks that could pay off handsomely, or crash and burn.

Let's look at how Wade makes his money.

Basketball and massive paychecks

Since joining the NBA in the 2003-2004 season, Wade has made over $136 million playing basketball. His current contract paid him $15 million last season and he's due to make another $16.1 million next season if he opts-in to his player option.

Along with LeBron James, Wade has mastered the art of taking short-term contracts to increase his flexibility and allow for larger annual contracts. In 2014, he signed a two-year, $31.1 million contract with a player option after the first year, setting him up to be a free agent when the soft salary cap increases from $67.1 million to $89 million for the 2016-2017 season. More importantly, the luxury tax, which teams use to sign their own players and certain exemptions over the salary cap, will increase from $81.6 million to $108 million for the 2016-2017 season. That's when the big paydays will come and Wade is set to cash in.

But for all of his accomplishments, Wade was only the 21st highest-paid player in the NBA last year, according to ESPN. He made far less than players like Joe Johnson ($23.2 million), Rudy Gay ($19.3 million), and Brook Lopez ($15.7 million).

That's not reason to feel bad for Wade, though. He's made tens of millions more in sponsorship deals, including a high-profile deal with a sports brand in China.

"Lily Collins Was Praised for Losing Weight to Play Anorexic Character
Lily Collins was shocked when she was complimented for losing weight to play an anorexic woman in Netflix’s upcoming series To the Bone. During an interview with The Edit published on Thursday, June 29, the actress, who suffered an eating disorder herself in the past, said that people’s obsession with being thin is why the disease exists.

From Rosie O'Donnell's and Jordin Sparks' respective 50 pound weight losses to Biggest Loser winner Rachel Frederickson's whopping 155 lighter frame, see before and after pictures of celebrities' weight loss transformations.

“I was leaving my apartment one day and someone I’ve known for a long time, my mom’s age, said to me, ‘Oh, wow, look at you!'” Collins told the site. “I tried to explain [I lost weight for a role] and she goes, ‘No! I want to know what you’re doing, you look great!’ I got into the car with my mom and said, ‘That is why the problem exists.’”

The role hit home for Collins, who previously revealed that she suffered an eating disorder.

“There’s a scene where I’m taking my clothes off to be weighed by Carrie Preston, my stepmom in the movie, who takes a photo on her phone and shows it to me. I didn’t think she’d actually take one but she did,” Collins recalled. “I saw myself in the photo and my heart dropped. So when my mom saw the film, she saw Lily’s reaction because she knows me the best.”

The scene caused her mom to breakdown.

"The Bachelorette’s “Men Tell All” Episode Will Ignore This Season’s Biggest Problems
Next week, Bachelorette fans will finally get to watch all of Rebecca “Becca” Kufrin’s exes—a.k.a. the eliminated contestants—gather together in one room. That is, save for one: Lincoln Adim, who was convicted of indecent assault and battery offscreen as the show aired its pretaped season. Adim will not be present, nor will the season’s finalists—including Garrett Yrigoyen, whose social-media history also caused a furor among fans.

The “Men Tell All” episode, which tapes later than the competition portion of the series, has traditionally been used as a platform on which the show can discuss controversies like these, which took place offscreen while the series aired. (The special was recorded just this week.) But with Adim and Yrigoyen absent from the group, this one will gloss over both controversies—which, together, have been the center of most of the season’s discussion. Both Kufrin and franchise host and producer Chris Harrison, however, want viewers to keep an open mind—at least, regarding Yrigoyen.

“I want to be very careful about people that put Garrett and Lincoln in the same sentence because they do not belong in the same sentence,” Harrison told The Hollywood Reporter after the episode finished filming. “What Garrett did is something that people disagree with. What Lincoln did is illegal. It’s against the law. He committed a crime. He was convicted of that, so that’s very different. . . . That’s not to say that I agree at all with what Garrett did or if he stood for that or what he stood for,” Harrison added, “but I’m very careful to differentiate those.”

For those who need a refresher, Yrigoyen emerged as a front-runner as soon as this season premiered, nabbing the coveted First Impression Rose—which is frequently awarded to the show’s eventual winner. Just as the season premiered, however, Yrigoyen’s offscreen life proved troublesome: on a subsequently deleted Instagra","0"
"Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Had Another Sneaky-ish Wednesday Date Night
Today in #Jelena watch, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez spent Wednesday night out together—but they tried to be sneaky about it. Gomez and Bieber arrived at church in Bieber's Jeep. They entered the building separately, but the same woman in the photo alongside them makes it clear they walked in the door only seconds apart.

BACKGRID Justin arriving.

BACKGRID Selena arriving.

Church-goers also spotted the two—and one filmed Gomez at the front of the church. The back of Bieber's head appears to be visible in the video because of his current Shaggy-esque blond hairstyle.





They were not photographed, filmed or said to be showing PDA at service like they have during previous weeks. Bieber's rumored ex-fling Kourtney Kardashian was also photographed arriving at the same service.

Wednesday night public date nights are kind of Jelena's thing. Since they reconciled in the fall, Bieber and Gomez have been regularly seen by Los Angeles church-goers at Wednesday night service (sometimes kissing) and have been often photographed by paparazzi at the ice rink that same evening. Bieber plays hockey almost weekly and devoted girlfriend Gomez occasionally (boredly) watches.

Gomez just returned to Los Angeles yesterday morning. She was photographed getting off the plane in sweats, out hiking later with her assistant Theresa Mingus, and then ultimately in a jean jacket at church with the Biebs. Her full outfit from service is likely the one from that afternoon, photographed more clearly below:

The latest report about Bieber and Gomez's relationship came out over the weekend after news broke that Gomez spent two weeks in a treatment program in New York City for anxiety and depression.

"Stacy London On Her Year Of Going Broke
Without a job to go to, and with a good enough excuse not to, I started to spend money almost mindlessly: I ordered in food twice a day (mostly Bareburger and mostly with the Caviar app). I bought toys for my dog Dora — toys I could barely pick up. I paid for my housekeeper and a full-time driver I couldn’t take anywhere. And after you’ve binged every available Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon series (old AND new), the next logical activity? Online shopping, of course! (Well, for me anyway.) As a result, my phone is now home to every brand and retail app on the planet, each at the ready for swiping and shopping-cart-filling aplenty. This sounds almost ridiculous as I type it. I consider myself to be a smart person. Smart people don’t spend money recklessly. There are very few things I consider hard to admit, but this is one of them. Always being independent and being on my own has been a point of pride for me. And like eating too many sweets when you’re on a strict diet, there is a deep shame in spending this way. I’m a grown-up, but surgery, sadness, and immobility had me acting like a child: stomping my feet like Veruca Salt. I want what I want when I want it, dammit!","0"
"Issa Rae Explains How She Ruined Her Chance to Become Rih...
Issa Rae won a Peabody Award for her Emmy–nominated series Insecure. But even she gets a little tongue-tied in front of Rihanna.

On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Rae explained she ran into Riri at the Met Gala. Although the two have already met, it didn't stop Rae from getting a bit flustered.

""I just saw her sitting at the table and I had had a few drinks,"" explained Rae around the 1:50 mark above. ""So I was like 'Rihanna's over there, let me go say hi, she knows me, we homegirls.' And I went up to her and I was like, you know, tapped her. And she was so friendly and nice, I wasn't expecting that, and she was like 'Hey girl, good to see you!' And I was like 'Uh...oh...we're, uh...' and just excused myself and walked away. So any chance that we had to be best friends, I ruined it with my drunken nervousness, starstruck-ness.""

This likely won't be the last time the two cross paths though since Rae is supposed to be writing a Twitter-conceived heist film starring Lupita Nyong'o and Rihanna. In the meantime, the two definitely have at least one thing in common—they've both been pursued by Drake. While RiRi made it clear she's not interested in the Toronto rapper, Rae once again stated she did not turn him down at the Golden Globes.

""I was heading to the HBO party, as I should, and he [Drake] was leaving the HBO party. And so we crossed paths and he said the most magical words ever. He was like 'I've been looking for you all night.' And I was like 'You talking about me?' And he was like 'I'm about to go to this Netflix party, do you want to go?' And I was like 'Oh I have to go stop in the HBO party' because they're the network that puts my show on, I couldn't just ditch the party and go to Netflix party even though that's what I really wanted to do. So I was like 'I'll catch you at that party.' That was it. Then I went to the party and all of a sudden blogs were reporting that I turned him down which","0"
"The Bachelorette Just Isn’t Fun Anymore, and the Reasons Why Are Depressing
The newest season of The Bachelorette is upon us, and what better way to distract ourselves from our humdrum lives than by watching America’s most attractive, eligible real estate agents and personal trainers bare their hearts and embarrass themselves on national television? From the cringe-inducing first episode — as contestants one-up each other to make the most memorable first impression with over-the-top romantic gestures, pickup lines, and (this season) one contestant’s miniature mannequin of himself — to the surreality of the hometown dates, the show, like the whole of the Bachelor franchise, makes for incredible entertainment. But the fairy-tale fantasy of The Bachelorette is becoming more difficult to escape into as in recent seasons, the issues and traumas of the real world have crept into the formerly protective confines of the Bachelor Mansion.

When The Bachelor premiered in 2002, it became an instant hit — even Jennifer Aniston names the show as a guilty pleasure. The format hasn’t changed much since: Between 25 and 31 beautiful, accomplished women vie for the heart of a conventionally handsome, invariably white man through a series of competitions and staged dates, with on- and off-camera white wine spritzers fueling catfights and tear-filled breakdowns.

The Bachelorette followed a year later in 2003 — an attempt to flip the sexist premise on its head by giving the romantic upper hand to the woman, with 30 handsome suitors to compete for her affections. Unfortunately, even in the fantasyland of Bachelor Nation, true equality would take more than a simple gender flip — these women are still products of the real world, conditioned to be gracious and self-effacing.

Bachelorettes gracefully endure overenthusiastic romantic attention from often drunk contestants ranging from creepy (this season’s Tickle Monster and his gigantic fake hands) to annoying (Lucas Yancey, whose stated o","0"

"How to make the sleeper hit of the summer without even showing your movie in theaters
Were you one of the many, many people — technically countless, because much like the formula for Coca-Cola or Taylor Swift’s political persuasion, Netflix’s viewing numbers are not for the masses to discover — who, charmed by a delightful trailer and clamoring to escape the all-consuming horror and drudgery of everyday life in 2018, found yourself whiling away a summer day watching Netflix’s original romantic comedy, Set it Up?

For those who have yet to indulge in streaming’s sleeper hit of the summer: Kirsten (Lucy Liu) and Rick (Taye Diggs) are the high-powered bosses of put-upon assistants Harper (Zoey Deutch) and Charlie (Glen Powell), exhausted twenty-somethings who dream of one day actually getting out of the office while it’s still daylight and pursuing their passions: He yearns to be a present boyfriend for his model girlfriend, she has fantasies of becoming a journalist, starting with writing an article she’s only drafted in her mind. So the underlings pull a Parent Trap (Harper thinks they’re Cyrano-ing; she is incorrect), utilizing their scarily-thorough intel and total control over their bosses’ lives to matchmake their managers. As genre requires, the hijinksers become the hijinksed, the right people find love, the wrong people get caught, and everyone lives to strive another day — all to a peppy, sunny soundtrack.

There’s snappy banter, revelations about purpose and meaning and love, and kissing on the jumbrotron…and it’s great. It’s stuffed with delicious, supporting turns from comedy-land favorites: Tituss Burgess from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Pete Davidson of SNL (and BDE) fame, Search Party‘s Meredith Hagner. It is a sip of lemonade in this swampiest of summers, a much-needed break from breaking news.

"‘Gossip Girl’ Star Ed Westwick Accused of Rape, Actor Denies Claim
Actress Kristina Cohen has accused Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick of rape. The television star has denied the claim, saying that he does not know the accuser.

Cohen — who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood (she called the outpouring “both triggering and emotionally exhausting”) — alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during “a dark time in my life.” Her mother was sick with cancer (she died three months after the alleged assault) and she did not have the support system to deal with “the aftermath of the rape.”

Reached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen’s account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.

Westwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, “I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.”

The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick’s home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor’s home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when “Ed suggested ‘we should all fuck.'” Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling “to smooth everything over” while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.

After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.

“I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck ","0"

Under rainy skies, designer Kate Spade was laid to rest in her hometown of Kansas City on Thursday.

Archie Andrews is back on set! After Riverdale lead KJ Apa was involved in a car crash last Thursday, fans were concerned for the actor’s safety.

But his close-knit co-stars have taken to social media to reassure the CW show’s stans that Apa, 20, is doing just fine.

Camila Mendes, who plays Veronica Lodge, posted a photo of Apa lying on the ground looking at his phone to Instagram Stories late Thursday night, writing, “@kjapa u good?”

And Cole Sprouse, who plays Archie’s bestie Jughead Jones, also shared a close-up shot of Apa’s face. The red-headed actor appeared to be in costume, rocking Jugheads signature hat, as the cast films season two.

Apa himself posted to Instagram Stories on Thursday from the set, filming his co-star Martin Cummins, who plays Sheriff Keller, at the police station.

Apa’s car accident happened last week in Vancouver, Canada, where the show is filmed. The Hollywood Reporter said that Apa had fallen asleep behind the wheel after working a 16-hour day and was then taken the hospital for his injuries in the crash.

"Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett Settle Divorce 6 Months After Filing: Report
Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett are one step closer to finalizing their divorce.

The reality star and former NFL player have settled the details of their divorce, according to The Blast. The new filing includes details about custody, support and property and has been submitted for approval to the judge.

Earlier this month, Wilkinson, 33, gave an update on the status of their split, saying she signed her “last divorce paper.”

“Signed my last divorce paper Friday. Brutal,” she tweeted Oct. 15. “I gave it all I got. Truly did. I’m beyond proud of myself!! Fought to save til the last second. Oh well. Life goes on. Bye lol.”

Wilkinson filed for divorce from Baskett, 36, in April after nearly nine years of marriage. The same day she filed, Baskett responded with his filing and mirrored her documents. Both cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split, listed their date of separation as Jan. 1, 2018, and requested joint legal and physical custody of their two children: son Hank IV, 8, and daughter Alijah Mary, 4.

According to the documents, Baskett requested “reserve for future determination the issue of support payable to” both parties.

The former Playboy model’s filing came hours after she confirmed in an Instagram post that they’d broken up.

"For the first time in Grammy history, a white man isn’t nominated for album of the year
Before the 2018 Grammy nominations were announced Tuesday, many prognosticators thought the race for album of the year would boil down to two artists: British pop star Ed Sheeran for “÷ (Divide)” and rapper Kendrick Lamar for “DAMN.” Sure enough, Lamar’s record made the list, along with Childish Gambino (“Awaken, My Love!”); Jay-Z (“4:44″); Lorde (“Melodrama”); and Bruno Mars (“24K Magic”). But Sheeran was nowhere to be found, much to the devastation of his fans — although “÷ (Divide)” did land a nod for best pop vocal album.

Soon, the absence of Sheeran’s expected nomination led to a Twitter “moment,” as the social media platform announced that the “Grammys album category has no white men for the first time in 19 years.”

However, that depends on how you look at the alternative rock band Garbage: While Shirley Manson is the lead singer, the group also includes Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker. (In fact, Manson was the last member to join the band.) So if you count Garbage and search through every other album of the year category since the Grammys started in 1959, this actually marks the first time in history that no white men have been nominated for the night’s biggest prize.

This is especially notable for the Grammys, which saw lots of criticism last year when Adele’s “25” won over Beyoncé’s “Lemonade.” The year before that, Taylor Swift’s “1989” beat Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly.” And the year before that, Beyoncé’s self-titled album lost to Beck’s “Morning Phase.”

“For the past five years, black artists have been making era-defining pop music, some of which has been nominated for the heaviest Grammy in the land, album of the year,” Washington Post music critic Chris Richards wrote after last year’s show. “Then, when ‘music’s biggest night’ eventually rolls around, each and every one of these a","0"
"How Goop’s Haters Made Gwyneth Paltrow’s Company Worth $250 Million
On a Monday morning in November, students at Harvard Business School convened in their classroom to find Gwyneth Paltrow. She was sitting at one of their desks, fitting in not at all, using her phone, as they took their seats along with guests they brought to class that day — wives, mothers, boyfriends. Each seat filled, and some guests had to stand along the back wall and sit on the steps. The class was called the Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports. The students were there to interrogate Paltrow about Goop, her lifestyle-and-wellness e-commerce business, and to learn how to create a “sustainable competitive advantage,” according to the class catalog.

She moved to the teacher’s desk, where she sat down and crossed her legs. She talked about why she started the business, how she only ever wanted to be someone who recommended things. When she was in Italy, on the set of “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” she’d ask someone on the crew about, say, where the best gelato was. When she was in London, on the set of “Shakespeare in Love,” she asked a crew member where to find the best coffee; in Paris, she asked an extra where to find the best bikini wax; in Berlin, the massage you can’t miss. She wasn’t just curious. She was planning this the whole time.

The first iteration of the company was only these lists — where to go and what to buy once you get there — via a newsletter she emailed out of her kitchen, the first one with recipes for turkey ragù and banana-nut muffins. One evening, at a party in London, one of the newsletter’s recipients, a venture capitalist named Juliet de Baubigny, told her, “I love what you’re doing with Goop.” G.P., as she is called by nearly everyone in her employ, didn’t even know what a venture capitalist was. She was using off-the-shelf newsletter software. But De Baubigny became a “godmother” to Paltrow, she said. She encouraged her vision and “gave permission” to start thi","0"

'When Audrina was pregnant, she reached out a lot and asked me some questions, like what pregnancy jeans I liked, and that kind of stuff,' said Kristin.

'I've talked to her since she's had the baby and she sounds like she's just loving life.'

The ladies: (L to R) Whitney Port, Lauren Contad, Audrina Patridge and Heidi Montag

She added they want to meet up.

'Audrina and I talked about getting the kids together. It's just so hard because we're in Nashville and everyone's out there. But I did tell Audrina that both my boys will be in school in the fall, so when I bring Saylor out, I would love to make that happen.'

As far as Heidi, who is married to Spencer Pratt, she said: 'I put together a little list of different products and toys that I've loved and sent that over to her.'

The ""Jersey Shore"" star appears in a preview clip from tonight's new episode, which sees him getting a message from the other side from one of his late friends.

""My best friend in the whole entire world, he passed away like 11 years ago,"" Pauly said of his deceased friend, Billy Iannotti, who died in 2005. ""This was like my best best friend, he passed in a motorcycle accident. We were together all the time.

""I don't talk to anybody about this,"" he added, ""I'm a public figure but I'm private in that aspect of him.""

""There is a visual that's going through, the feeling is, 'If I weren't turning, I would be fine, but I'm up straight,'"" Tyler Henry says. ""And this is the weird thing that's coming across, 'I don't have enough time to be able to correct anything that would have gone wrong.' The feeling is, 'The center of balance isn't the center of the vehicle' ... the focus is almost like, 'I don't have the balance.'""

The Ukranian choreographer, 37, cited undisclosed “personal issues” for skipping the show, forcing Alan Bernsten to fill in for him.

I take full responsibility for my absence and want to apologize to my partner Vanessa. We are both looking forward to dancing for our fans next week!”

Amber Portwood is not interested in Matt Baier’s new life. The Teen Mom OG star “doesn’t care” about her ex-fiance’s surprise marriage, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly.

Related: Teen Mom Stars, Then and Now! It’s been quite a journey for the cast of Teen Mom. The series launched in December 2009 as the first spinoff from MTV’s 16 and Pregnant.

Aquaria, Kameron Michaels, Eureka and Asia O'Hara are the four queens competing in the season 10 final of RuPaul's Drag Race.

Although, as Asia admitted in a recent episode, the real winner of the series is probably Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

Despite leaving in episode one Miss Vanjie made an impression that lasted an entire series.

But it's one of the remaining queens who will be crowned America's next drag superstar when the final episode airs.

Who deserves to take the title? We spoke to Drag Race superfans for their predictions on who they want to win - and why.

At 21, New Yorker Aquaria is the season's youngest contestant and after winning the most challenges is statistically the favourite to win.

Like previous winners, she's never landed in the bottom two - so has never faced elimination.

""I think people dismissed her initially as an 'Instagram queen',"" says 26-year old superfan Hayden East, who followed Aquaria on social media before she entered the show.

""Whereas previously Instagram queens have fallen short in other areas - like Miss Fame or Kim Chi who did really great in terms of looks but didn't quite reach the bar with dancing, performance, acting or comedy - I really feel like Aquaria has shown herself to be very well rounded.""

Hayden says she has surpassed previous young competitors and been portrayed as a fully-fledged star, rather than a rising talent. And she's also been impressed with her knowledge of drag and LGBT culture.

Former ""Dance Moms"" reality star Abby Lee Miller arrives at the Joseph F. Weis Jr. US Courthouse, May 8, 2017, in Pittsburgh for her sentencing on federal bankruptcy fraud charges.

— -- Former ""Dance Moms"" star Abby Lee Miller has been sentenced to one year and a day in federal prison for bankruptcy fraud and for bringing $120,000 worth of Australian currency into the country without reporting it.

According to ABC affiliate WTAE in Pittsburgh, U.S. District Court Judge Joy Flowers Conti also ordered Miller to pay $40,000 in fines and spend two years on supervised release after serving time in jail.

Miller, 51, apologized to the judge for her actions and said she regrets them every day.

Conti told Miller she could transition to a halfway house after serving 10 months of her sentence. She must report to prison in 45 days.

Miller was indicted on fraud charges in 2015 for allegedly hiding from a bankruptcy court $775,000 in income she earned after filing a petition to reorganize her Pittsburgh dance studio in 2010.

Last June, she pleaded guilty to purposely hiding that income. She also pleaded guilty to an unrelated charge of sneaking $120,000 in foreign currency into the United States from Australia, which, according to The Associated Press, she agreed to forfeit.

"Westworld Season 2 Episode 1 Premiere Recap
🚨 Spoilers for Westworld Season 2 Episode 1, ""Journey Into Night,"" below. 🚨

Westworld is back for round two, which means the next several months will largely consist of you getting into arguments on Reddit and feeling extremely uncomfortable about Sophia the Robot's presence in your Twitter feed. But before we jump into Season 2, Episode 1, let's go over where we left off with the Season 1 finale:

Dolores shot Dr. Ford at a party celebrating his final narrative. Said party was filled with Delos employees, whoops.

At the same time, Maeve's robot rebellion began—and the Man in Black was shot in the arm.

Maeve made what appears to be her first sentient decision, opting to stay in the park to find her daughter.

Teddy, Bernard, and presumably the rest of the robots are in the nascent steps of self-realization. (Remember, the order is Memory > Improvisation > Consciousness.)

A note about this episode's timeline: The Season 2 premiere seems to take place during two time periods. The first is the present day; it follows Bernard hooking up with Delos' tech team, features weird flashbacks that show Dolores in modern-day garb, and ends with Bernard admitting to killing all the hosts. The second is two weeks prior, in the immediate aftermath of the board gala massacre. This is where the majority of the episode takes place.

Real quick, here's a side-by-side of Bernard's differing looks between two weeks ago and present day. Why he changed outfits is unclear, but this is a helpful identifier if you ever find yourself confused about which Bernard you're watching.

HBO Left: Bernard two weeks ago; Right: Bernard present day.

Without further ado, let's get to the recap.

PRESENT DAY

We learn Westworld's location.

The Westworld premiere begins with Bernard (wearing a gray suit) lying on the beach surrounded by bodies. Based on the length the park's been ""offline,"" it's been about two weeks since Maeve and Dolores' robot rebellion.","0"

Tavis Smiley's show dropped by PBS amid 'troubling allegations' of misconduct

Show Caption Hide Caption PBS suspends Tavis Smiley show amid sexual misconduct claims PBS is suspending distribution of late-night talk show Tavis Smiley following sexual misconduct claims levied against its host. USA TODAY

PBS's late-night talk show Tavis Smiley was suspended Wednesday after ""multiple, credible allegations"" of misconduct emerged about the popular host/producer. Smiley greeted the news with shock and outrage.

PBS sent a statement to USA TODAY late Wednesday declaring that the public broadcaster had ""indefinitely suspended"" distribution of Tavis Smiley, produced by Smiley's independent production company, TS Media.

""PBS engaged an outside law firm to conduct an investigation immediately after learning of troubling allegations regarding Mr. Smiley,"" the statement read. ""This investigation included interviews with witnesses as well as with Mr. Smiley.

Should I let my child watch the Netflix show, 13 Reasons Why? https://mediatrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Untitled-1.png 750 300 Mediatrics https://mediatrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Untitled-1.png

Q: My daughter is 13 and an eighth grader in middle school. Her friends have recently become obsessed with the Netflix show, 13 Reasons Why. I haven’t read the book or watched the show, but have been seeing a few news articles that worry that the show may be dangerous for kids to watch graphic depictions of suicide, bullying and forced sex. My daughter feels that it is only “drama” (in the teen use of the word), and she’s been feeling left out of the conversation with her friends. Is it ok for me to let her watch it?

~ Just One Reason Why Not, USA

A: Dear Just,

Your question is timely. Many parents (and educators, judging from the flurry of school-parent communication around the country) have been concerned about the content of 13 Reasons Why and its massive popularity among pre-teens and teens. It is currently the most popular Netflix show on social media, in part because it is being heavily marketed to adolescents, with a personal social media campaign from Executive Producer and powerful teen influencer, Selena Gomez. The show’s subject matter is titllating because it is, as your daughter says “teen drama”. The problem is that she and her peers may not yet be neurodevelopmentally capable of processing that “drama” in healthy, safe ways.

Although it is based on a popular YA novel (for readers 12-18), 13 Reasons Why is rated TV-MA (unsuitable for viewers under 17) and several episodes are preceded by an onscreen “graphic content” warning. As you’ve seen with your own daughter, media made for older adolescents and adults are attractive to younger kids. Younger kids’ media consumption is aspirational, meaning that they look to older kids, including media representations, to see how","0"

"Chrissy Metz's Tragic Real-Life Story
Chrissy Metz has gained worldwide fame since starring in the hit NBC drama This Is Us. Appearing alongside actors Mandy Moore, Sterling K. Brown, and Justin Hartley, Metz plays Kate Pearson, a 30-something struggling with her body image. Since the series' debut in 2016, the character has been a fan-favorite that many viewers have found incredibly relatable. ""You don't realize that somebody who's average or even very fit could relate to someone who's overweight,"" Metz told People in February 2017, ""but it's not about our size — it's how we look at ourselves and how we feel about ourselves.""

Despite Metz's on-screen success, we'd wager that most TV fans don't know about the details of the actress' tragic real-life story. From family troubles and heartbreaking issues related to her weight to a failed marriage and financial strain, Metz has gone through a lot over the years. She's overcome a childhood littered with insecurities to emerge into the self-assured woman she is today, but it hasn't been easy for the former American Horror Story star.

Keep reading to learn all about the toughest moments of Metz's personal life. Be warned though — like This Is Us, Metz's story is a tearjerker.","0"

Reese Witherspoon is known for being an ageless beauty.

And the 40-year-old A-lister proved her age-defying looks even more so when she stepped out for lunch in Santa Monica with teen daughter Ava, 17, on Tuesday.

The Wild star and her eldest appeared as though they could be twin sisters while grabbing a bite at Blue Plate with their adorable French bulldog Pepper.

She teamed the feminine printed blouse with dark denim jeans that encased her slender pins.

A pair of dark shades sat neatly on her nose and shielded her piercing blue eyes from the southern California rays.

"Prince Harry Takes Meghan Markle for Tea with Queen Elizabeth
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle‘s road to engagement just hit another milestone.

The couple visited Buckingham Palace for a private tea with Harry’s grandmother Queen Elizabeth, according to a new report in the Daily Mail by authoritative royals columnist Richard Kay.

The couple, who have been dating for at least 15 months, arrived in a Ford Galaxy station wagon with blacked-out windows for the discreet appointment last Thursday. They were then “whisked up to the Queen’s private sitting room” for the hour-long meeting, Kay reports. (We assume her no-fail, go-to jeanswere not her choice of attire for this particular occasion!)

Splash News Online

Later that evening, Harry was in top form as he accepted a posthumous award honoring the HIV/AIDS activism of his mother, Princess Diana, at the Attitude magazine awards.

Spokespeople at Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the report.

There is critical significance in Markle’s meeting with the Queen. Harry is fifth in the line of succession (he’ll be pushed to sixth after William and Kate welcome their third baby this spring), meaning he has to have the monarch’s permission to wed.

There had been rumors that the Suits star and the Queen may have met earlier — during a visit to Balmoral Castle in Scotland.

Last month, Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, made their public debut as a couple at the Invictus Games in Toronto, where they held hands at a wheelchair tennis event and spent time with her mom, Doria. Before the games, Markle had spoken in a way that no other royal girlfriend or boyfriend had done so before, saying they were “two people who are really happy and in love.”

And if there is any doubt that Harry would need to worry about securing his grandmother’s approval, one inside source tells PEOPLE he would be in the clear. “If Harry asks for something, she would say yes as she adores him,” the source says.

"Sarah Silverman and Michael Sheen Broke Up Because of Trump and Brexit
Trumpism and Brexit are often said to have failed to bring people together, and now the twin votes are being blamed for shattering one celebrity couple’s love affair.

The British actor Michael Sheen has claimed that he and the comedian Sarah Silverman broke up because of their passion for politics, and it wasn’t that they disagreed.

Both, in fact hold similarly anti-populist views, but, in a new interview, Sheen says that he and Silverman parted ways because she wanted to spend more time in America engaged in her I Love You, America project, which challenges Trumpism, and he wanted to be engaged in anti-Brexit campaigns in the U.K.

Sheen, who has previously compared the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the ’30s, told the Daily Telegraph that he was inspired to become more politically active by the Brexit referendum.

At the time, he and Silverman were living together in the U.S., but the votes signaled the end of their four-year relationship.

“We both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions—because she is American and I’m Welsh.

“After the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved. That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.

“I felt a responsibility to do something, but it did mean coming back here—which was difficult for us, because we were very important to each other. But we both acknowledge that each of us had to do what we needed to do.”

Sheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.","0"
"Jill Messick’s Family Issues Blistering Statement on Harvey Weinstein and Rose McGowan
Veteran studio executive and producer Jill Messick died by suicide on Wednesday after battling depression for many years, her family tells The Hollywood Reporter.

Messick, who worked at Miramax as a production executive from 1997 to 2003, also served as Rose McGowan’s manager in January 1997, which is when, McGowan has claimed, she was raped by Harvey Weinstein.

In a statement following her death, her family says Messick was “victimized” after becoming embroiled in the Weinstein-McGowan allegations. Her name made headlines when Weinstein’s attorney, Ben Brafman, released an email on Jan. 30 attributed to Messick in defense of his client. Her family says now that Messick “became collateral damage in an already horrific story.”

Messick’s family’s full Feb. 8 statement is below.

“The Movement” just lost one of its own.

Jill Messick was a mother of two children, a loving wife and partner, a dear friend to many and a smart entertainment executive. She was also a survivor, privately battling depression, which had been her nemesis for years.

Today she did not survive. Jill took her own life.

Jill was victimized by our new culture of unlimited information sharing and a willingness to accept statement as fact. The speed of disseminating information has carried mistruths about Jill as a person, which she was unable and unwilling to challenge. She became collateral damage in an already horrific story.

Jill believed in the Movement. She supported every woman finally coming forward to share their dark truths and expose those who had committed previously unspeakable deeds. She was loyal. She was strong. Jill was many things, but she was not a liar.

Over the past few months, many women have come out with allegations against Harvey Weinstein, including Rose McGowan, who has repeatedly spoken with the press, striking out against not only her alleged attacker, but a great many others. One ","0"

"Farrah Abraham Arrested After Fighting with Beverly Hills Hotel Employee
Farrah Abraham was arrested after an alleged altercation with a hotel employee, PEOPLE confirms.

“On June 13, 2018, at approximately 1:19 a.m., Beverly Hills Police officers responded to the Beverly Hills Hotel for a report of a disturbance inside the hotel restaurant. Officers arrived shortly thereafter and made contact with the person complained of, Farrah Abraham,” a spokesperson for the Beverly Hills Police Department tells PEOPLE.

“A male adult hotel security officer reported that he asked Abraham to leave the hotel after she refused to disengage from a verbal altercation with hotel guests,” says the spokesperson. “The security officer reported that Abraham struck him in the face with her forearm, grabbed his ear and pushed him in the face as he attempted to prevent her from re-entering the hotel. Officers noted that Abraham exhibited signs of intoxication during the investigation.”

According to the spokesperson, the victim “sustained minor injury and was not transported to a hospital.”

Abraham was arrested for misdemeanor battery and trespassing pursuant to a private person’s arrest. She was booked at the Beverly Hills Jail and is being held on $500 bail.

“We can confirm there was an incident involving a patron in the Polo Lounge this morning,” a spokesperson for the hotel tells PEOPLE. “As this is an ongoing investigation with the Beverly Hills Police Department, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.”

Abraham’s rep tells PEOPLE, “This situation has been blown out of proportion.”

“Farrah has not been charged and was released this afternoon,” the rep continues. “A misunderstanding occurred and there was no battery or trespassing.

Destiny’s Child line up at one time consisted of LaTavia Roberson, LeToya Luckett, Kelly Rowland, and Beyonce Knowles (Picture: Everett/REX/Shutterstock)

Question: tell me what you think about…this.

A fan theory is doing the rounds online that we are so here for – we could have a Destiny’s Child reunion on our hands.

Original members LaToya and LaTavia could well be teaming up with Bey, Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland, if this is all to be believed.

The theory goes that Destiny’s Child are reuniting for Coachella 2018 and it would appear they have each been dropping hints to suggest it.

AND WE ALL KNOW BEYONCE LOVES A HINT DROP.

Example one: the album hint.

Example two: The twins hint.

So here is the fan theory, discovered by Buzzfeed, encapsulated in one handy tweet and a quick explanation.

Beyonce uploaded a snap of herself wearing an AC/DC top, but only showed the DC. DC = Destiny’s Child. Boom.

Michelle Williams uploaded a snap of the outfit she wore when she last performed with Destiny’s Child at the Super Bowl, you know, just to remind us she was once in the group.

A consistent theme of both the series and sentiment among Serena’s friends and family is her many layers. She’s a tennis master, entrepreneur, fashion designer, and philanthropist. Her most recent and proudest accolade agreed upon by all, including Serena herself, was the birth of her daughter, Olympia. On the red carpet, Serena told Vogue: “The one thing I’m most proud of is becoming a mom. That is everything, hands down.” On what she has not yet accomplished but would love to, Serena said, “Becoming a multi-mom. I have some records I want to break, but having more kids is my goal.” Olympia is already proving to be a stylish baby thanks to Serena’s good taste. When dressing her, often in mommy-and-me matching style, Williams said, “I just think about things that are comfortable and easy to change a diaper. I get most of her clothes on Amazon. They have great, fun clothes. I want her to be very humble, and I want to start that at an early age.” Ohanian added, “I am so proud and in awe of my wife!”

Venus agreed with Serena on her sister’s greatest accomplishment: “She’s a tennis champion and an unbelievable mom. She does everything for the baby. Balancing her career is not easy, especially when you’re a world tennis champion. I’m most proud of her for that.” Designer Vera Wang shared similar sentiment, telling Vogue: “Underneath that incredible champion is a very human woman. When she gets off the court, she has a desire for a very different kind of life. People will understand the struggle of what it is to be a champion at that level. It’s a wonderful dichotomy—people see the glamour, they see the wins, they see the trophies. But they don’t know what that struggle is day in and day out. There are two sides: There’s the woman side and there’s the champion side, and they’re really one in the same.”

Corrections/clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of David Foster's children. He has five biological children and six stepchildren.

Congrats are in order for Katharine McPhee and David Foster. They're engaged!

The Canadian composer, 68, popped the question to the actress and singer, 34, during their European vacation this week, Foster's rep Kimberly Jakwerth confirmed to USA TODAY Tuesday.

McPhee seemingly commented on the engagement Tuesday by sharing a gif to Twitter with a ring emoji.

""And what about it?"" the gif reads.

The happy couple have been vacationing in Italy, according to their social media accounts.

Although a ring is not visible, they seem to be enjoying the sunny weather and snapping photos of each other.

McPhee also shared a screenshot conversation between her and Just Jared founder Jared Eng that details how Foster proposed.

""He did it at the top of this mountain in Anacapri... Totally dark only stars... Thankfully he didn't push me off the cliff... He said it was one or the other. And in the end he spared me,"" she wrote with a laughing emoji.

The couple reportedly began dating last year. Their most recent appearance was at the 2018 Met Gala in May, where they walked the red carpet together arm-in-arm. In March, they also attended the Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards viewing party together.

Foster has been previously married four times. From 2011 to 2017, he was married to Yolanda Hadid, the mother of supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid. He does not share any children with Hadid, but has five biological children with other partners.

"Woman who was left with 'zombie boobs' after failed surgery could lose her nipple
A woman who was left with 'zombie boobs' after a failed fat transfer has to decide if she is willing to risk losing her nipples by having a second surgery to fix her deformed breasts.

In a preview clip from Thursday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched, Dr. Terry Dubrow warns his patient Shannon that it is a high-risk procedure because she doesn't have a great deal of blood supply coming into her nipples.

Although he has yet to lose a nipple over the course of his career, the surgeon admits that it's a possibility if Shannon decides to go under the knife again.

Looking for help: Shannon asks Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif to fix her misshapen 'zombie boobs' on Thursday's episode of the E! reality series Botched

Yikes: The patient was left with deformed breasts after a failed fat transfer

'So, this is old. This is dead fat. So, all that fat transfer did was die,' Dr. Dubrow tells Shannon as he examines her breasts.

'For a fat transfer to the breast to work, the fat has to be good and the tissue you're transferring it to has to have good blood supply,' he explains during his confessional.

'In Shannon's case, that is absolutely not going to work, and, in my opinion, is a very weak solution.'

After nixing the possibility of a second fat-transfer surgery, Dr. Dubrow gives Shannon a rundown of the multi-step procedure she will have to undergo to fix her breasts.

The surgeon's complicated approach includes reconstruction and a new pair of implants.

'The breast tissue loss that you have from the original operation means the blood supply coming into the nipple is not that robust, he says. 'This is a risky procedure. I could lose your nipples with this.

Oct. 18 (UPI) -- Celebrity couple Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez have raised $35 million for Puerto Rico disaster relief.

The 48-year-old singer and 42-year-old retired MLB player helped secure $26 million for victims of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria before raising another $9 million during a benefit concert Saturday with Lopez's ex-husband, Marc Anthony, according to Entertainment Tonight.

Lopez and Rodriguez personally raised $26 million in corporate pledges and donations from the business, sports and entertainment industries prior to their One Voice: Somos Live! concert with Anthony. The remaining money came in during the telecast.

"Who Did Emily Maynard Pick: The Bachelorette Dumps Arie and Makes the Right Choice
It is official! Emily Maynard and Jef Holm, the edgy, Mormon entrepreneur, are engaged to be married.

In a tearful season finale Sunday night, after meeting daughter Ricki for the first time, Jef got down on one knee and proposed to Emily, to which she hastily accepted. However, instead of rejecting the proposal of Arie Luyendyk Jr., the racecar driver, she respectfully let him go the day before, sparing him the embarrassment that many before have experienced on the show.

Interestingly, it was later revealed that after the show ended Arie traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, the hometown of Emily, because he didn’t feel their emotional breakup had enough closure. Although he didn’t see Emily, they talked on the phone, and he dropped off the diary he kept with him throughout the journey on her doorstep, urging her to read through it. However, Emily has not yet read the diary, and she revealed as much last night on the live portion of the show when she took out the diary which was still inside a sealed envelope.

Will Jef and Emily last? Only time will tell. But, I can tell you that they definitely have a better shot at working out than she would have had with Arie, whose fast-paced racecar driver lifestyle would be difficult to juggle with a family. Jef, on the other hand, is the much safer bet: not only does his job seem very flexible, but also he expressed his feelings to Emily whereas Arie demonstrated them physically and sexually. If she had chosen Arie, their relationship would most likely have suffered.

With another season of The Bachelorette in the record books, who will be the next man chosen to be on The Bachelor? My two bets would be Arie and Sean Lowe, the insurance agent who made it all the way to the final three in Curacao only to be let go. Rumors say it will be Sean, but don’t count Arie out. Both would make for interesting seasons.","0"
"Danielle Staub Relationship with Ex-Husband Marty Caffrey's Children
The Real Housewives of New Jersey mom doesn't believe she's to blame for her ex's relationship with his kids.

Danielle Staub's road to the altar hasn't exactly been a smooth one, as we've seen this season of The Real Housewives of New Jersey. Not only has her wedding prep put a strain on her friendship with Margaret Josephs, but it has also put a microscope on some of the challenges in her relationship with her groom, Marty Caffrey.

How to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New Jersey on Peacock and Bravo.

Specifically, Danielle's revelation in Wednesday night's episode of RHONJ that she doesn't get along with Marty's three children left the rest of the Garden State crew speechless. ""I command respect,"" Danielle shared during the episode. ""If you're not going to respect me, stay out of my space.""

Marty then said that no one is responsible for how this situation turned out, and he concluded the conversation by expressing how painful it has been to see his kids and his future wife at odds. ""I chose you at the detriment of them and my relationship with them,"" he said to Danielle on RHONJ. ""And therefore, we have to move on. Life is short. That's all I have to say.""

Danielle addressed her comments about Marty's children in an Instagram post published in advance of the episode airing on Wednesday, December 19. ""Here’s my message. I love all children of all ages! Keep in mind [that] his kids are well into their 30s. They are adults living on their own,"" Danielle wrote in an Instagram post that featured a photo of herself with Margaret, Melissa Gorga, and Teresa Giudice while they were in Bimini in the Bahamas for her wedding.

"The controversy over Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas’s wedding, explained
Last weekend, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas got married, and the ceremony was very beautiful indeed; honestly, it kind of made Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s nuptials look like they took place in the service bathroom of a Wegman’s.

A musician and former member of the Jonas Brothers, Jonas met Chopra, a Bollywood actress who starred in the now-canceled ABC show Quantico, at an Oscars after-party in 2017. The two had only been publicly dating for a few months before he proposed to Chopra last August.

Over the past few months, there’s been much buzz about the stars’ brief courtship, as well as their age difference: Chopra is 36, while Jonas is 26. There’s also been a great deal of chatter about their multi-day wedding, which was very publicly documented on the two celebrities’ Instagrams and featured references to a number of prominent brands, from Amazon to Elit Vodka.

But while the snark surrounding the Chopra/Jonas union is largely unmerited (they’re young! They’re hot! They’re talented! They’re in very public love! What’s there not to celebrate about that?), it is understandable why so many people are talking about it. Here’s what you need to know about the couple, why so many people are talking about them, and why we should all calm down and revel in the nuptials of two celebrities with an exceptionally adept knowledge of the marketing landscape.

How Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas met

Even in a year of short celebrity engagements, much has been made of Chopra and Jonas’s whirlwind courtship: The two were only publicly dating for a few months before reports surfaced that Jonas rented out a Tiffany store to pick out an engagement ring for Chopra.

But as we learned in a recent Vogue profile on the couple, the two have known each other for almost two years, first meeting at an Oscars after-party in 2017. (They reportedly texted for a few months before meeting in person, which will sound ","0"
"Amazon Sets ‘The Lord of the Rings’ TV Series In Mega Deal With Multi-Season Commitment
In its quest to launch a hit fantasy series of the Game of Thrones caliber, Amazon has closed a massive deal — said to be close to $250 million — to acquire global TV rights to The Lord of the Rings, based on the fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. The streaming service has given a multi-season commitment to a LOTR series in the pact, which also includes a potential spinoff series.

The LOTR original series, a prequel to Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring, will be produced by Amazon Studios in cooperation with the Tolkien Estate and Trust; HarperCollins; and New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment, which produced the hugely successful LOTR movie franchise.

No details about the deal were disclosed, but it believed to be dwarfing any TV series pact to date with a whopping price tag attached.

Amazon, Netflix and HBO had been approached by the Tolkien estate, who had been shopping the project. It came with an upfront rights payment said to be in the $200 million-$250 million range, and I hear Amazon landed the rights by paying close to $250 million. That is just for the rights, before any costs for development, talent and production, in proposition whose finances industry observers called “insane.” It is a payment that is made sight unseen as there is no concept, and there are no creative auspices attached to the possible series. On top of that, the budget for a fantasy series of that magnitude is likely to be $100 million-$150 million a season.

“The Lord of the Rings is a cultural phenomenon that has captured the imagination of generations of fans through literature and the big screen,” said Sharon Tal Yguado, Head of Scripted Series at Amazon Studios. “We are honored to be working with the Tolkien Estate and Trust, HarperCollins and New Line on this exciting collaboration for t","0"

"How to watch the 2018 Golden Globes online tonight
Awards season is up and running this weekend with the 75th Golden Globe Awards, which will kick things off with Hollywood’s least serious award show. But even if winning a Golden Globe isn’t considered as much of an accomplishment as winning an Oscar, the Globes can often indicate which way the Hollywood winds are blowing. Here’s everything you need to know to enjoy the red carpet.

Who’s the host?

Seth Meyers, who you may know from his NBC late-night show, the aptly named Late Night with Seth Meyers. Or maybe you somehow caught his appearance in the 2008 movie Journey to the Center of the Earth — which, last I checked, was most notable for killing off the last vestiges of Brendan Fraser’s cinematic career.

It’s Meyers’ first time hosting, but he’ll be following in the talk-show-host footsteps of Jimmy Fallon, who hosted the Golden Globes last year. So at least the bar has been set for Meyers’ brand of humor. NBC is marketing the show under the tagline “Hollywood, we have a lot to talk about,” so expect lots of fun and not-at-all uncomfortable and awkward humor about the recent turmoil in Hollywood over sexual harassment and abuse.

Meyers has commented in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that he took the gig in the first place after conversations with his wife and women on the writing staff, viewing it as “an opportunity to be able to say some things that you wouldn’t be able to say in previous years.”

Who’s up for the big awards?

On the film side of things, The Shape of Water, (seven nominations), The Post (six nominations) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (also six) lead the pack. Lady Bird (four nominations) is also in the mix for several big awards, although not for Best Director, since that category once again completely overlooked all female directors.

The awards aimed at TV shows are more widely distributed. HBO’s Big Little Lies leads with six nominations, but it’s up against a sla","0"

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A woman has come forward to say she was involved with Kevin Hart a month ago but she is not an extortionist.

Montia Sabbag (mahn-tee-uh suh-bahg) spoke to reporters at her lawyer's Los Angeles office Wednesday following Hart's weekend apology to his pregnant wife and children via an Instagram video for what he called an error in judgment.

He also said someone was trying to seek financial gain from his mistake and he'd rather confess than let that happen.

Sabbag says that since her involvement with Hart, her name and pictures have become public and lies have been written about her.

"Showtime fires back at Sarah Palin's claim that Sacha Baron Cohen posed as a veteran for 'Who Is America?' interview
Showtime has finally released a statement regarding the drama surrounding Sacha Baron Cohen and his controversial new show, Who Is America? — and the network is firmly supporting its star.

Sarah Palin was one of the many political figures duped by the comedian, and she alleged that Cohen posed as a veteran for their awkward sit-down. The actor via his character, Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., PhD, denied saying he was a “war vet” to gain access to the former Republican vice presidential candidate, and Showtime is backing Cohen up, pointing to Sunday’s premiere episode as proof.

“There has been widespread misinformation over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., Ph.D., performed by Sacha Baron Cohen on the SHOWTIME comedy series WHO IS AMERICA?” the statement begins. “Baron Cohen did not present himself as a disabled veteran, and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere on Sunday can now attest to that. In Sunday’s episode, during an interview with Senator Bernie Sanders, Baron Cohen in character as Dr. Ruddick was asked by the Senator if he is disabled, and he stated that he is not and uses a mobility scooter to conserve his energy.”

It’s true — Sanders blatantly asked Cohen, who was in disguise, if he has “a disability.” Cohen replied, “No I don’t. This here scooter is to conserve my body’s finite energy.”

Showtime’s statement continues, “In addition, Baron Cohen never presented himself as a veteran of the U.S. military to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin during the booking process or during the filming of her interview, and contrary to her claims he did not appear in a wheelchair. In both the interview with Governor Palin and the interview with Senator Sanders, he did not wear military apparel of any kind.”

"Alyssa Milano addresses The CW's Charmed reboot: 'I wish that they would have come to us'
Original Charmed stars Holly Marie Combs and Shannen Doherty have already addressed The CW’s upcoming reboot. Now the third sister is sharing her thoughts.

“I wish that they would have come to us and we would have been involved since the beginning,” Alyssa Milano said during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “But having said that, I do hope that it reaches the newer generation and impacts that generation the way ours was able to do for its generation.”

The CW greenlit the self-described “fierce,” “funny,” “feminist” reboot with Sarah Jeffery, Melonie Diaz, and Madeleine Mantock as three sisters who discover they’re actually witches. They must then try to balance their life in a college town with supernatural demon-hunting.

Milano costarred with Combs and Doherty in the original series. Rose McGowan came on as long-lost half sister Paige when Doherty’s Prue character was killed off.

Combs, especially, has been very vocal about the reboot. “Let me say first that I appreciate the jobs and opportunities the Charmed reboot has created,” she wrote, in part, through a statement. “But I will never understand what is fierce, funny, or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago. I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain.”

Doherty had also tweeted initially that the concept was “offensive.” She added, “I love Charmed. I also want it to be respected. I’m simply choosing to be constructive about it because negativity has no place in my life.”

The new stars and producers have responded to the pushback, also coming from certain pockets of the original fans, multiple times. During the Television Critics Association tour, Mantock said, “Of course, you can’t help but feel disappointed because I think the script is fantastic. I really hope maybe [Combs will] see it and ","0"

Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston met on the set of Tropic Thunder in 2007, started dating in 2010 and got married five years later - but it could have been a very different story. The 46-year-old actor has revealed that he actually had the opportunity to audition for Friends, the sitcom that made his wife a household name, more than 20 years ago.

His reason for skipping the audition that could have changed his life? He wanted a lie in.

Theroux told that he ""didn't bother"" to turn up, admitting: ""I slept in that day."" He then went on to add that it was probably for the best because, had he got the gig, he ""wouldn't have been prepared for [the fame]"".

The actor, screenwriter and director (he co-wrote Tropic Thunder and Zoolander 2 with friend Ben Stiller) also revealed how Aniston often sense checks his jokes.

""When it's not funny, she calls me out. She says, 'That's not funny',"" he said. When asked if she allows fart jokes in the house, he added: ""Of course she would allow a fart joke, but I think she actually has a more refined sense of humour than to crack a fart joke. I think she's funnier than that.""

"Katy Perry explains meaning of 'Swish Swish,' calls it 'great anthem'
The collective internet seems to have already passed judgment on Katy Perry's new track, ""Swish Swish,"" which is raising eyebrows over its possible lyrical shots at Taylor Swift. Perry was even asked by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Friday whether this song, off her upcoming Witness album, was about ""anyone we know."" While the pop diva remained cryptic, she explained the meaning of ""Swish Swish"" is ""liberation"" from bullies.

""I think it's a great anthem for people to use whenever someone's trying to hold you down or bully you,"" she said. ""That's kind of what this record is about, it's just like [a] 360-degree liberation."" If ""Chained to the Rhythm"" was about ""political liberation"" and ""Bon Appétit"" was a ""sexual liberation,"" then Perry calls ""Swish Swish"" ""the liberation from all the negative that doesn't serve you.""

Perry directed her fans to the segment on social media Saturday morning. ""Here's some of the tea and a biscuit,"" she tweeted.

Since ""Swish Swish"" dropped on Thursday, listeners, including Swift pal Ruby Rose, pointed to the lyrics as a diss track. ""I've always stood up for the people I love and against things I think are cheap or mean spirited. That's not new. You have to follow your [heart emoji],"" Rose wrote in a series of tweets.

Perry and Swift have reportedly been feuding since an alleged spat over backup dancers a couple of years ago. Swift's 1989 hit ""Bad Blood"" has long been rumored to be a strike against Perry, and when asked by Entertainment Weekly if Witness included a response to the Swift song, Perry said it was ""not my question to answer—if it's about me.""

She further explained, ""I think [my new album is] a very empowered record. There is no one thing that's calling out any one person. One thing to note is: You can't mistake kindness for weakness and don't come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that's not to any one person and don't quote me that it is,","0"

Lopez was married to Anthony for seven years and the former couple share nine-year-old twins Max and Emme. They separated in 2011, and their divorce was finalized in 2014.

The “On The Floor” singer, 48, moved on from Anthony with Smart, her backup dancer at the time, and the duo dated on and off from 2011 to 2016.

Fans pointed out the unlikely pairing, writing things like “WhenTheExesLinkUp” and “Oh my how awkward” on Smart’s Instagram.

"Linkin Park Singer Chester Bennington Dies in Suicide
Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington has died, Brian Elias of the Los Angeles County coroner’s office confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. He was 41.

The coroner’s office said it had been on the scene at the singer’s home in Palos Verdes Estates investigating a suicide. On Friday, Ed Winter, spokesman for the coroner’s office, said Bennington hanged himself. An autopsy is pending. No timeframe was given for report results.

Neither the coroner nor Los Angeles County Fire Department could confirm reports the death was due to hanging.

Law enforcement received a call around 9 a.m. reporting the death, Elias said. Palos Verdes police said it was unclear if the department was going to release a statement on the matter.

Linkin Park bandmember Mike Shinoda wrote on Twitter: “Shocked and heartbroken, but it’s true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one.”

Bennington, a Phoenix native, was open about his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction, which occurred at various times during his life.

The band had just released its seventh studio album, One More Light, and was set to embark on an extensive North American tour this summer and in the fall.

The group was one of the most popular rock bands to emerge in the early 2000s. Their debut album Hybrid Theory has sold more than 10 million copies in the U.S. since its release in 2000, per Nielsen SoundScan.

The band won Grammy awards in 2001 for best hard rock performance for “Crawling” and again in 2005 for best rap/sung collaboration for “Numb/Encore.”

On May 26, Bennington sang Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” at the Los Angeles memorial service of Soundgarden rocker Chris Cornell, who had died by suicide. Days earlier, in a note posted online, Bennington wrote a tribute to his friend Cornell saying: “I can’t imagine a world without you in it. I pray you find peace in the next life.”

David Beckham is opening up about the secret to his long marriage with Victoria Beckham.

""To have been married for the amount of time that we have, you know, it's always hard work,"" Beckham said during a sneak peek of an interview with Australia's The Sunday Project, which is set to air this weekend.

The former soccer player and Posh Spice, who have been hitched for 19 years and have four children together, frequently deflect breakup rumors that have intensified over the past year.

However, Beckham acknowledged their relationship is complex. ""It becomes a little more complicated,"" the former athlete said during the teaser.

He also discussed the power couple's children – sons Brooklyn, 19, Romeo, 16, and Cruz, 13, and daughter Harper, 7 – and his journey through fatherhood.

""Sometimes it’s the little things that make a big difference,” Beckham said. “I’ve noticed that with my children. … The thing we have to do is protect our children.”

Most recently, Victoria Beckham squashed speculation in June that the couple was heading toward divorce with an adorable Instagram post of her hugging Harper with an equally gushy caption: ""We love and miss u @davidbeckham.""

""People have been making things up about our relationship for 20 years, so David and I are pretty used to ignoring the nonsense and just carrying on as normal,"" the fashion designer said in her October cover story for British Vogue.

"102 Pre-Wedding Songs for Getting Ready With Your Bridesmaids
The hours leading up to your wedding ceremony are arguably some of the most exciting and nerve-wracking ones you'll experience throughout the entire planning process. To ensure this time is as fun and relaxing as possible, we recommend curating a playlist of upbeat, lively songs that you and your wedding party members can listen to while you're prepping for the walk down the aisle. A soundtrack of beloved tunes will help create a celebratory atmosphere and keep everyone's energy up during hair and makeup.

Your playlist should be unique to you and your musical preferences, but to help you choose the right tunes, we rounded up a list of editor-approved wedding getting ready songs. Our selections include a little bit of everything—here, you'll find modern favorites like Billie Eilish's ""Birds of a Feather"" and Sabrina Carpenter's ""Espresso,"" girl-power anthems like Shania Twain's ""Man! I Feel Like a Woman"" and Chaka Khan's ""I'm Every Woman,"" and wedding-worthy classics like the Dixie Cups' ""Chapel of Love"" and Etta James' ""Sunday Kind of Love."" As a good rule of thumb, add at least 50 songs to your wedding getting ready playlist; if the average song is three minutes in length, that should give you about two-and-a-half hours of music. If you know your group will be in hair and makeup for longer than that, increase the number of tracks accordingly or plan to repeat the playlist.

"Amber Portwood 'ready' to rekindle Farrah Abraham friendship
Aug. 31 (UPI) -- Amber Portwood says she's ""ready"" to be friends with Farrah Abraham again.

The 27-year-old television personality said Wednesday in an interview with E! News that she wants to end her feud with her 26-year-old Teen Mom OG co-star.

""[Farrah] has a very strong mind and strong opinions. So do I. So I think it's natural for us to clash,"" Portwood explained. ""Plus, she's crazy. We used to be friends, but I don't know what happened. I think she did things for publicity.""

""I still love her to death. She knows that,"" she qualified. ""I'm ready to just let everything go. With her, it's on her terms, so I'm not really putting any effort into it or thinking about it.""

The Teen Mom stars' recent conflicts include Abraham sending Portwood a cease-and-desist letter for ""making false and defamatory statements about Ms. Abraham to the media,"" according to People. The pair also got in a physical altercation in October while filming the Season 6 reunion special.

Portwood confirmed Oct. 23 that she and her fiancé, Matt Baier, confronted Abraham and her dad, Michael Abraham, after Abraham and her then-boyfriend, Simon Saran, said Baier looked like a ""pedophile.""

"‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Season 2 Is Brutal and Not Much Else
On the show, though, June is so special that her scowl might as well be on the currency for the revolution. Her husband confronts her captor in Canada. She delivers her own baby. Even though people died to help her escape at the beginning of the season, she’s determined now to stay in Gilead, because I guess Season 3 has to be about something. One read is that there’s no escaping the suffocation of a subjugating regime. Except within the show, there actually is escaping it — and yet June has decided not to.

Season 2 has been dutifully brutal, complete with ample torture, rapes, executions and murders. It gave in to every one of the show’s most tedious instincts, substituting slow stares and endless montage sequences for any actual development or new interiority. Every inch of existence is awful. Cookies are inedible. Oprah is in exile. We’re at the North Pole of misery and being told to walk north.

So all the show can do is walk in circles. June’s primal wound is being separated from her daughter Hannah. That can’t be heightened on, so instead, Season 2 just repeats it. This, too, could seem eerily resonant, given the human rights crisis at the Mexican border that saw immigrant children being separated from their parents. But not entirely, because one essential flash point of present-day America “The Handmaid’s Tale” ignores is race and ethnicity. Our United States definitely does not.

June’s trauma repeats, and so does everyone else’s. June’s pal Emily (Alexis Bledel), who last season was punished by having her clitoris cut off, was sent to the gulag, as was Janine (Madeline Brewer), who last season had her eye removed. After they toiled for a few episodes, it was back to Gilead for them both — back to desultory trips to the market and conspiratorial whispers. Would Nick’s child bride ruin everything? No; she was executed, and then everything was back to bad-normal.","0"
"DeMario Jackson, Corinne Olympios Spending Valentine's Day Together
Bachelor in Paradise‘s DeMario Jackson and Corinne Olympios are spending the most romantic day of the year together.

During former Bachelorette contestant Eric Bigger’s podcast, Bigger Talks, on Wednesday, Jackson shared details of his friendly relationship with Olympios, even sharing their Valentine’s Day date plans.

“I can’t wait for tonight,” he said.

“Just for the fact that – you know, we’re homies. We’re really good friends, and you know, we just enjoy each other’s company and we like to take things slow,” Jackson added.

Further clarifying, “We hang out. We have fun, and you know, that’s it.”

Despite the BiP sex scandal that rocked season 4’s production last summer, Jackson and Olympios remain close.

The pair has been spotted out and about multiple times over the past few months, sharing a friendly embrace in late August, leaving TAO restaurant in Hollywood in late September, and most recently celebrating Halloween together in Los Angeles.

In October, Jackson opened up about his friendship with Olympios.

“In the media — the media wanted black versus white. They wanted angry black guy, they wanted this little white girl. But in reality, both of us were put against each other,” he said at the time.

“It was one of those things that people want us not to be friends. They want to paint a particular narrative. Even now the narrative is they’re friends now,” he explained. “It’s like, ‘Oh, it’s fake.’ It’s always you’re damned if you do, you’re damned if you don’t.”","0"

Tonya Harding has long denied she knew a plan was afoot to injure Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.

That, actually, was not the case, Harding said in Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story that aired on ABC on Thursday night. In fact, she said she basically figured out that her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, Shawn Eckardt, had likely been behind the plot to attack Kerrigan shortly after she won the U.S. figure skating title.

Harding stuck to her story that she's repeated for 24 years now: She had no role in planning the attack. In part of the interview that ran on Good Morning America earlier this week, Harding, however, said she did overhear Gillooly and Eckardt talking about ""taking somebody out"" to ensure Harding made the 1994 U.S. Olympic team.

""It popped in my head two or three days after we got back (that Gillooly and Eckardt were involved),"" Harding said in part of the interview that didn't run until the two-hour special Thursday night.

Fighting back. Renee Zellweger’s team is denouncing allegations that she had inappropriate encounters with Harvey Weinstein in order to escalate her career.

The claims came to light in a class-action lawsuit that six unnamed women recently filed against Weinstein, alleging that Zellweger, 48, and Charlize Theron both ascended in their professional endeavors by performing “sexual favors” for Weinstien, 65.

“If Harvey said that, he’s full of shit,” a rep for the Bridget Jones actress, who has starred in several films produced by the former studio exec, including Cold Mountain which she won an Oscar for in 2004, told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, December 7.

Weinstein responded to the claims in a statement to Us on Monday, December 11: “Mr. Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them. It’s ridiculous that anyone would believe these talented women, Academy Award winners, provided sexual favors in exchange for roles they earned based on their talent and brilliant work. It’s simply not true.”

As previously reported, the former Miramax producer made headlines in October after nearly 30 years of sexual assault and abuse allegations came to light in expośes published by The New York Times and The New Yorker. North of 60 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct to date and he has since been faced with several lawsuits and expelled from the Television Academy.

"Mira Sorvino Says We Can Get Very, Very Excited for the 'Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion' Sequel
After nearly three decades, there's another reunion in store for Romy and Michele. Mira Sorvino, who starred in the beloved 1997 film with Lisa Kudrow, confirmed that a sequel to Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion is in the works and that all the puzzle pieces are about to fall into place. There's only one snag — Emily in Paris. Robin Schiff, the writer behind the OG Romy and Michele, is currently working on Netflix's hit series and that project is the only hurdle keeping the Romy and Michele team from getting everything going.

“She’s currently working on Emily in Paris, so she’s finishing up her draft to present to the studio,” Sorvino told Us Weekly. “Lisa [Kudrow] and I are wrapping up our deals as executive producers on it with the studio. We’re full force ahead.”

In addition to Sorvino and Kudrow, the film starred Janeane Garofalo, Alan Cumming, Julia Campbell, Vincent Ventresca, Elaine Hendrix, Justin Theroux, and Camryn Manheim.

Though she didn't reveal much about the plot of the movie, Sorvino did tell Us where she envisioned everyone's favorite BFFs 40 years after their high school graduation.

"The Bachelor’s Arie Luyendyk Jr. Reveals the Self-Imposed Rule He Broke on the First Night
We’ve already been warned that the new season of The Bachelor will have plenty of drama — not to mention tears, races, multiple women named Lauren, and even taxidermy! And according to the man in the middle of the action, Arie Luyendyk Jr., things heat up pretty quickly.

Sitting down to chat with E! News, the reality star discussed how things will be different for him this time around. Thanks to his age (at 36, he’s older and wiser than when he first appeared on our screens in 2012) and his new career (he’s still a race car driver, but is doing real estate as well), he seems to be pretty sure of where he’s coming from and what he wants out of this romantic situation.

Which is not to say he won’t slip up every once in a while. In fact, he did just that on night one of The Bachelor, when he broke a rule he made for himself before the season started.

“That first night, I told myself I’m NOT going to kiss anybody,” Luyendyk Jr. told E! News when asked if his infamous nickname “The Kissing Bandit” added any pressure to the circumstances. “And then it happened.” That’s right — he put his make-out skills to good use on the very first night.

He may have done the one thing that he promised himself he wouldn’t do, but it doesn’t seem like he’s especially upset about it, so we’re going to go ahead and guess that “The Kissing Bandit” enjoyed that initial peck (or two?).

We actually already know that Brittany scored herself a smooch when she issued a creative challenge to Luyendyk. But was she the only one?

We’ll be able to see for ourselves when The Bachelor premieres January 1 on ABC.

He reportedly made the unpopular decision of cancelling the rest of his world tour to 'start a church.'

And after denying religious reasons, fresh new claims have emerged of Justin Bieber, 23, experiencing a 'spiritual awakening' which has led to a 'new purpose' in his life other than music.

According to TMZ, the decision stems from his relationship with Hillsong Church founder Carl Lentz, which allowed him to reflect on his 'own view on the path in life he should be taking.'

New purpose? Fresh new claims have emerged of Justin Bieber experiencing a 'spiritual awakening' which caused him to cancel the remainder of his Purpose World Tour

The Canadian singer, who has an 'intense' relationship with Lentz, was also described as the 'Tom Cruise of that church.'

This comes after the What Do You Mean? singer denied that he cancelled his Purpose World Tour to start a church, simply telling TMZ on Tuesday: 'No, you already know the reason.'

"Teen takes Danny DeVito cutout to prom and he responds perfectly
A Danny DeVito superfan has got his attention – after she took a cardboard cutout of him as her prom date.

Pennsylvania student Allison Closs couldn’t find a living, breathing date for her dance, so she decided to order one online.

In a YouTube post about it, she said:

I couldn’t find myself a date in real life or with an actual human. So I bought one on Amazon. I have always loved Danny. I loved him on It’s Always Sunny in Philedelphia, I loved him in Hercules and Matilda. I just love him in every form he takes. Danny was there for me when I really needed him. He treats me the way a woman should be treated.

In the video, she ‘interviewed’ her dad, who told her that though he’s a “little bit older…”

He’s a very nice man and I think he’s going to treat [his daughter] with a lot of respect.

The initial video went viral and people viewed it thousands of times.

Closs’ photo with cardboard DeVito was shared widely online – it was even upvoted more than 100,000 times on Reddit.

In fact, it spread far and wide – and waltzed right onto Danny DeVito’s radar.

The veteran actor’s It’s Always Sunny co-star Rob McElhenney spotted her picture and DeVito felt compelled to respond in kind:

I heard you took cardboard Danny to Prom. What a coincidence. He took cardboard Allison to Paddy's [the pub in It's Always Sunny].

Slide for IRL Danny >>>

And when Closs found out about DeVito's homage to her, well, the wonderful story came full circle.

The internet is a great thing, sometimes.

"Minnie Driver Rationalizes Matt Damon's Sexual Harassment Remarks: He's a 'Nice White Male'
Minnie Driver is once again calling out her former costar and boyfriend Matt Damon for his previous comments about sexual misconduct in Hollywood and beyond.

In December, Damon told ABC News that the alleged sexual misconduct of powerful men represented a “spectrum of behavior,” explaining that he believes there is “a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.”

He also said, “I think it’s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it’s totally necessary.”

Driver, who criticized Damon for the comments at the time, told the New York Times on Tuesday that she feels Damon “represented every intelligent, nice white male who feels it is their job to comment on the way that women metabolize stuff.”

Rob Kim/Getty; Michael Loccisano/Getty

She added, “That somehow we should have a hierarchical system whereby touch on the arse is this, tits is this, you know, front bottom, back bottom, over the shirt, rape! That there would be some criteria.”

Driver advocated for involving men in the women’s movement, saying “there’s no way to move forward unless we do this together.”

In January, Damon apologized for his controversial comments, telling the Today show, “I really wish I’d listened a lot more before I weighed in on this. Ultimately what it is for me is that I don’t want to further anybody’s pain. With anything that I do or say, so for that I’m really sorry.”

Driver also told the NYT she supported a “model of truth and reconciliation,” referring to commissions that were established after the Rwandan genocide and South African apartheid, in which victims of violence were given a platform to speak.

“Women get to be heard,” she explained. “You get to be seen and heard and the accusers get to hear that and get to me","0"

“Judi Dench is my pick,” Karp said. “If I could write a rap battle for anybody, it would be Dame Judi Dench.”

“I’d like to see Judi Dench vs. Maggie Smith,” added Corden. “Dame on Dame, saying everything they’ve dreamt of saying for the last 30 years.”

“It’s our Biggie and Tupac … it only ends with murder,” Karp wryly quipped.

The 16-episode series will premiere in the fall. Guests on the first season include Gina Rodriguez, Rob Gronkowski, Randall Park, James Van Der Beek and Vanessa Hudgens.","0"
"‘American Horror Story: Cult’ Mass Shooting Episode Edited in Wake of Las Vegas
Tuesday’s episode of American Horror Story: Cult, which was set to feature a scene in which a mass shooting occurs, has been edited to be less graphic following the deadly Las Vegas shooting in which 58 people were killed and hundreds more injured.

Ryan Murphy, co-creator and showrunner of the FX horror anthology, first made the comments Saturday during a New Yorker Festival discussion. The scene in question was filmed before the shooting in Las Vegas occurred, with Murphy explaining that they shot the sequence in September even though they’re still filming this season (several of the actors have already wrapped). “I just made the decision that I’m going to have all of that violence be shown for the most part off camera,” he said of editing the episode after it was in the can and locked before the tragedy in Vegas.

On Monday, FX confirmed the episode would see “substantial” edits for Tuesday’s telecast but that the original unedited episode would then be released on VOD and streaming platforms.

“In light of the tragedy last week in Las Vegas, Ryan Murphy and the producers of American Horror Story: Cult have chosen to make substantial edits to the opening scene of [Tuesday] night’s episode,” FX said in a statement. “This opening, which was filmed two months ago and which portrays an occurrence of gun violence that has sadly become all too common in our country, contains a sequence that some viewers might find traumatic.”

The network says the edited episode will air on the FX linear channel, while the unedited and original version will be available on the VOD platform of cable, satellite or telco providers, as well as on the FX Networks non-linear platforms, FXNOW and FX+.

When speaking about the decision on Saturday with the New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum, Murphy said he felt a “responsibility” to victims of gun violence.

The ad follows a fictional day in Swift's life, including her ""unbelievable choreographed fight sequence"" with Samberg. The pair previously collaborated on a skit for a 2014 episode of Saturday Night Live.

""Such a taxing day when they're like 'eat some cookie dough' and you're like 'ok I'll make this sacrifice for my art,' Swift captioned a behind-the-scenes video from the commercial's shoot.

"Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley had a Fault in Our Stars reunion at the Globes
The stars aligned at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday evening in Los Angles, when the lead actors of emotional teen film The Fault in Our Stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort were reunited.

Woodley attended Sunday’s awards ceremony along with her fellow Big Little Lies costars and was nominated in the category of Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture for TV for her role in the HBO hit but lost out to Laura Dern. Elgort was also nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for playing the part of getaway driver baby in Baby Driver. He lost out to James Franco in The Disaster Artist.

Based on the novel by John Green, The Fault in Our Stars tells the story of a 16-year-old girl with cancer (Woodley) who meets and falls for 17-year-old Augustus Waters (Elgort), an ex-basketball player and amputee.

Despite neither winning an accolade, the duo seemed happy enough just bumping into one another in the ballroom and cuddled up for a snap.

“She deserves all happiness in the world,” Elgort wrote on Instagram alongside the image. “To be in the same room at the Golden Globes with a woman who helped guide me early in my career when she was already a Golden Globe nominee, was a surreal moment. Life coming full circle.”","0"

In footage that was captured at the hospital ahead of the surgery, Jennings snaps her fingers and says “let’s do this” before heading into the operating room.

“Also this season, you’ll see me turning 18 years old. I go to prom with my friends and I mean, I can’t spill all the secrets,” she teases.

The TLC star — she was born male but identifies as female — confirmed in a previous YouTube video titled “Preparing For Gender Confirmation Surgery” that her surgery was scheduled for Tuesday, June 26.

“It’s coming up so soon. June 26 is when I’m getting the surgery, so like a month away. That is insane. I am so looking forward to it. I’ve been ready for this my entire life,” she shared.

Later in the video, she said, “It’s crazy to me. I’m going to have new genitalia. Like penis to vagina. That’s some serious s—, y’all.” Said Jennings: “I can’t believe it, I’m going to have a vagina!”

Following the surgery, Jennings shared a post-operation photo to social media.

“I’m doing great, thanks for all of the love and support,” she tweeted alongside the selfie.

"Sam Smith Releases First Song in Two Years, “Too Good at Goodbyes”
The drought is broken: Sam Smith is back with his first new music in two years. The British soulman returns with “Too Good At Goodbyes,” his first release since 2015’s “Writing’s On The Wall” from Spectre, which became the first James Bond theme to hit No. 1 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart.

Written with longstanding collaborator Jimmy Napes and Stargate, “Too Good At Goodbyes” builds into a gospel chorus and showcases Smith’s exceptional range. The torch track is “about a relationship I was in and it’s basically about getting good at getting dumped,” says Smith. “It’s been a long while since I’ve put any music out and I feel that this first single sets the tone of what is to come.”

On it, Smith sings “Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry / And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry / And every time you walk out, the less I love you / Baby, we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true,” hitting high notes which suggest he’s put behind him the vocal cord injury which plagued him in 2015.

Smith is coming off a spectacular start to his recording career. His debut album In The Lonely Hour was a smash, hitting No. 1 in the U.K. and shifting more than 12 million units worldwide. He’s gone on to collect an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, three Brit Awards, three Billboard Music Awards and four Grammys.

In support of his new release, Smith will play four dates later this month at venues yet to be confirmed. He’ll start Sept. 11 in Los Angeles, then head east with stops in New York (Sept. 13), London (Sept. 15) and, finally, Berlin (Sept. 18).

Stevie Nicks started to choke up as she gave a touching speech about her late friend Tom Petty during a pre-Grammys tribute event on Friday.

“The loss of Tom Petty has just about broken my heart,” Nicks, 69, said at the MusiCares Person of the Year event honoring Fleetwood Mac at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

“He was not only a good man to go down the river with, as Johnny Cash said, he was a great father and he was a great friend,” she added, after noting that his daughter Adria Petty was in the audience. “He was one of my best friends. My heart will never get over this.”

Nicks also went on to reveal how after the ceremony last year — where Petty was the night’s honoree — the late singer spent a lot of time “talking to me about how important it was to him. And maybe he was talking about it because [he] was ill. He was not well.”

“And he fought his way through that tour,” Nicks continued, referencing the 40th anniversary tour with the Heartbreakers that Petty embarked on in 2016, and finished just one week before he died on Oct. 2 of that year.

“He should’ve canceled, and he should’ve just gone home and gone to the hospital. But not Tom. He was gonna go down that river. And so, God bless him, he finished his tour at the Hollywood Bowl. Three shows. And one week later he died — but he got down the river,” she added as she began to choke up. “So Tom, I know you’re standing next to me cause you always have been for so many years.”

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie: Could they go to trial over the kids?

Show Caption Hide Caption 5 celeb couples that shattered our faith in love They made us fall head over heels, then they broke our hearts. A previous version of this video misidentified Jenna Dewan. USA TODAY

Wrap it up.

That’s what image experts would say to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, the once-golden couple now edging into explosive Hollywood divorce territory occupied by the likes of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow.

Today, ""most celebrities keep their divorces private, they settle them quickly usually with a press release,” says Christopher Melcher, partner of the California firm Walzer Melcher family law. “We rarely see this kind of nastiness that's happened recently.”

Brangelina is now shorthand for textbook anti-conscious uncoupling. Still, resolution – especially when six children are involved – is a thorny endeavor. So could this all end with a messy public spectacle?

After a summer of freshly boiled acrimony, the fractured family is back in Los Angeles, and the couple has seemingly recommitted to a previously agreed-upon temporary custody agreement. A scheduled hearing in family court on Aug. 21 was postponed. Pitt is seeing the children regularly.

Jolie “continues to support the reconciliation of the children with Brad and everything she does is focused on healing her family,” a source close to Jolie, who was not authorized to speak publicly, tells USA TODAY.

But what a road to get to this point.

A messy summer

In June, their divorce made headlines again when the couple's private judge threatened Jolie, saying if the actress doesn't start encouraging her children to forge relationships with her ex, she could be in danger of losing custody.

The judge further ordered Jolie to arrange a phone call with the kids and their doctors to explain to the children that “the court has determined that each of them are safe with t","0"
"Former Pussycat Dolls member calls group prostitution ring
Former Pussycat Dolls member calls group prostitution ring

A former member of the hit-making Pussycat Dolls, Kaya Jones, airs out the group’s dirty laundry.

In case you missed it, the singer recently took to Twitter where she alleged that her former group mates were a part of a prostitution ring.

“My truth. I wasn’t in a girl group. I was in a prostitution ring. Oh & we happened to sing & be famous. While everyone who owned us made the $,” she began. “How bad was it? People ask—bad enough that I walked away from my dreams, my band mates & a 13 million dollar record deal. We knew we were going to be #1.”

Jones, 33, took it one step further, calling out her “den mother” by writing, “I want the den mother from hell to confess why another 1 of her girl group girls committed suicide? Tell the public how you mentally broke us.”

Of course, it wasn’t long before fans suggested that the singer was referring to G.R.L. singer Simone Battle, who committed suicide in September of 2014.

“To be a part of the team you must be a team player. Meaning sleep with whoever they say. If you don’t they have nothing on you to leverage…Yes I said leverage. Meaning after they turn you out or get you hooked on drugs they use it against you. Correct. Victimizing the victim again,” continued Jones. “That’s why I have so much respect for our military. I’ve been through way. But my scars you can’t see. At least real war is honest. Why don’t we report it? Because we were all abused! I personally have been warned if I tell I will…you know end up dead or no more career.”

Meanwhile, neither a rep for the Pussycat Dolls nor Nicole Scherzinger has commented on Jones’ allegations.

However, Asia Nitollano, who was briefly a part of the group in 2007, took to Twitter to write, “Who is Kaya Jones? Lol She was not apart of The Pussycat Dolls the recording group so I do not know her. If she was in the Vegas show then I know nothing about that ","0"
"Oscars: Gary Oldman Wins Best Actor for ‘Darkest Hour’
Gary Oldman won the Academy Award for best actor on Sunday night.

The Darkest Hour star beat out Timothee Chalamet (Call Me by Your Name), Daniel Day-Lewis (Phantom Thread), Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out) and Denzel Washington (Roman J. Israel, Esq.).

The award capped off a season of other honors for Oldman at shows such as the Critics’ Choice, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA Awards. It was the first Oscar win for the actor. He was previously nominated for best actor for 2011’s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

In Darkest Hour, Oldman portrays revered U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the early days of World War II. The actor praised Churchill as he accepted his award, saying, “I would just like to salute Sir Winston Churchill, who has been marvelous company on what can be described as an incredible journey.”

Oldman concluded by thanking his mother, “who is older than the Oscar, she is 99 years young, next birthday. And she’s watching the ceremony from the comfort of her sofa. I say to my mother, ‘Thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on. I’m bringing an Oscar home.'”

Backstage, Oldman said that his Darkest Hour role held “special significance” for him. “I can’t say what it would be like to win an Oscar in any other year, but to win it for playing Winston makes it doubly special. It’s been an unforgettable experience.”

When asked what Churchill would say to today’s political leaders, Oldman replied: “He would probably give them a good talking to.”

"Scandal Season 6 Finale Postmortem: Bellamy Young on Luna, Cyrus Twists
[WARNING: The following story contains spoilers about Thursday's Season 6 finale of Scandal. Read at your own risk.]

Mellie Grant (Bellamy Young) is officially the new president of the United States, but she's not the most powerful person in the world.

Scandal wrapped up Season 6 Thursday with one twist after another in the two-hour closer. No, Mama Pope (Khandi Alexander) did not assassinate Mellie on inauguration day 1) because Rowan (Joe Morton) shoots her in the shoulder before she could pull the trigger and 2) because she was actually going to kill VP Luna (Tessie Santiago)!

Why? Olivia (Kerry Washington) figures out that Luna was the one who orchestrated the assassination on Frankie Vargas -- yup, her own husband! -- because she didn't want to be stuck as first lady and believed that she, as a sympathetic widow, would be able to accomplish more than Frankie ever could've in office. Luna thinks she has a trump card, telling Liv that, like Jackie Kennedy, she's untouchable and Mellie needs her to carry out her agenda. But Liv just needs a couple hours to gladiate: With Jake's (Scott Foley) help -- because they've both killed VPs (LOL) -- she pressures Luna into taking pills that would simulate a heart attack and thus kill her. That way, her ""legacy"" will still be intact and no one will ever know she had her own hubby killed.

Step 2 of Liv's plan involved her tricking Mellie into signing an executive order that would fund the reinstatement of B613, which Rowan had pushed Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) to do as his last act as POTUS. Fitz, for once, made a good decision for himself, nixed the order and headed off to Vermont, but not before a hot-and-heavy make-out sesh with Liv on the White House lawn. Now with Mellie's signature, B613 is back and Liv informs Rowan that she is going to run it.

"All The Times The Rock Proved He Was The Sweetest Dad
Dwayne Johnson might be a man of muscle, but he’s a big ol’ softie at heart. The 44-year-old actor has two daughters and believes that being a dad is “the greatest blessing.”

“I realized being a father is the greatest job I have ever had and the greatest job I will ever have,” he said on “Oprah’s Master Class” in 2015, before his second daughter was born.

“Throughout the years, throughout the ups and downs, I’ve realized that the most important thing that I could do with my daughter is lead our life with love,” he said. “Not success, not fame, not anything else but, ‘I’m always here for you. I love you.’”

The Rock had his first daughter, 15-year-old Simone, during his first marriage to Dany Garcia. He then welcomed his second daughter, one-year-old Jasmine, in December 2015 with his longtime partner Lauren Hashian.

Since having kids, Johnson has proven time and again that he is the sweetest dad. Here, we round up The Rock’s cutest moments with his girls.

“I'm always asked - What inspires YOU?” he wrote on Instagram last year. “My answer's easy and honest.. what inspires me the most is always waitin' for me to walk thru my front door when I come home.”

On an episode of “Oprah’s Master Class” in 2015, Johnson recalled a time he asked his teen daughter, “What is the thing that you love most about our relationship?”

“She said, ‘Well, that I trust you,’” he said, tearing up. “For a 13-year-old girl to say that to her dad... She said, ‘I trust you, and we have a very special bond.’ And that moved me. At 13, she’s saying that and, you know, I couldn’t ask for anything else. I love that girl.”

Even though The Rock was tired and sweating, he kept on dancing just to make his baby girl smile. “It’s what daddies do,” he said in the video.

“Josh gets on my ever-loving last f—ing d— nerve,” June vented to Geno. “I told him he needs to get a better job if he’s going to support my grandchild. Every time he thinks that I let my guard down, I’ll be right behind him saying, ‘Boom motherf—er.’ “

Pumpkin and Efird, 19, welcomed their first child, daughter Ella Grace Efird, in December. But before the baby arrived, June shared concerned that her daughter would face the same struggles she did as a teen mom.

“Pumpkin knows that ain’t none of my babies’ daddies stuck around,” she said. “But I don’t want the same thing to happen to her. She is 17, still in high school, supposed to be graduating this year and now she’s having a child.”

While June admittedly feuds with Efird as a means of protecting her daughter, she has also pushed Josh to find a better job to offer more financial stability.

“Pumpkin doesn’t understand bills. Like, she’s always coming [to me saying]. ‘Hey, I need $100. Hey I need gas,’ ” June told her boyfriend. “But if Josh thinks I’m always gonna be him and Pumpkin’s safety net, they got another d— thing coming.”



Geno attempted to smooth over June’s concerns, but the mom insisted the teens were in for “big wakeup calls.”

“Pumpkin, I’m always going to be there for her,” she said, “but Josh, he needs to shape up or ship out.”

In a solo interview, Geno remained optimistic that June and Efird would patch up their relationship once the baby was born — on one condition.

On Sunday, the pair once again fueled romance rumors with an outing together in Tokyo. Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) took Hadid to the renowned Robot Restaurant, an extremely unconventional dinner theater experience featuring performers dressed as monsters, animals and yes, robots.

The “Call Out My Name” crooner shared a video on his Instagram Story featuring Hadid cracking up while watching the performance. It ended with one of the restaurant’s robot-costumed actors playfully taking a fall.

Although Tesfaye and Hadid called it quits in 2016, they began to be spotted out together again -- including a PDA-filled night in Cannes back in May -- not long after Selena Gomez and he broke things off in 2017.

As recently as July 2, both Hadid and Tesfaye shared strikingly similar photos, seemingly teasing that they were spending time together. In the singer’s Instagram photo, he looks out over a balcony at what appears to be his home in Hidden Hills, California. Hadid’s image appears to have been taken moments later and features the same view but from further back, and includes the home’s spacious pool.

In an effort to get out of Los Angeles and take in some foreign culture, Kourtney decided to fly to France for the annual Cannes Film Festival, where she'd also get a chance to enjoy an idyllic getaway with her new man, Younes Bendjima.

But for Scott, the trip seemed to be more of a slap in the face, and he went a little too far with his reaction to the news that Kourtney was going on a romantic getaway.

""We got into like, a full war,"" Kourtney revealed to her sisters, Kim and Khloe Kardashian, recounting a series of phone calls and text message conversations the former couple had recently had.

""He was like, 'You're gonna have a great time,'"" Kourtney said, imitating Scott's sarcastic tone. ""And then he's threatening me now. He's like, 'Your little friend is gonna get beat up every single day when we're there.' He goes, 'Enjoy yourself. Walking around, you better watch your back.'""

""'I'm like, 'Oh, are you gonna have people attack me?'"" she continued. ""And he's like, 'You're the love of my life. Why would I have anyone attack you?... Just don't expect anywhere you go will be easy now.'""

These threats were not something Kourtney was willing to put up with, and the 38-year-old reality star put her foot down.

""I said, 'I will actually never speak to you again with your threats, you psychopath,'"" she shared. ""'If you threaten me and my friends, it's over. That's not how I will be treated. You've treated me horrible for years.'""

According to Kourtney, Scott also messaged her saying, ""Anyone who gets in the middle [between us] will not be pleased with the outcome.""

"Meghan Markle's Ex-Husband, Trevor Engelson, Reportedly Just Got Married
Meghan Markle's first husband, Trevor Engelson, got married to Tracey Kurland, a nutritionist, over the weekend, DailyMailTV reports. The couple had a low-key ceremony at a private home in Hidden Hills, California, according to the site.

The nuptials—which took place almost five months after Meghan and Prince Harry's royal wedding—were so secretive that barely any photos from the event surfaced online. But a few Instagram Stories captured by DailyMailTV give a glimpse at Engelson and Kurland's big day.

The images show Engelson wearing a light pink shirt under a gray-blue suit, with the bride in an off-the-shoulder, knee-length white dress with layered gold bracelets. She wore her hair in loose ombré waves.

Markle and Engelson were married from 2011 to 2013. They had a getaway wedding in 2011 in Ocho Rios, Jamaica with 102 guests, according to Us Weekly. For the beachfront nuptials, the bride wore a strapless sheath gown with a notch neckline and bejeweled belt. The laid-back, bohemian-inspired look was fitting for the shoreside venue, but a far cry from the Givenchy Haute Couture gown Markle had custom-made for her royal wedding to Prince Harry.

Engelson's engagement to Kurland was reported in June, just weeks after Meghan and Harry tied the knot. The producer announced the news on Instagram, although his account is private. ""Luckiest guy I know! Get ready to party!"" he wrote in a post.

Meghan and Harry have been to a number of weddings together since becoming a couple; they attended a friend's nuptials months after celebrating their own and are expected to be at Princess Eugenie's ceremony this Friday.","0"
"'Game of Thrones' and 'Westworld' Are Skipping Comic-Con
Yet another major pop culture player is foregoing a San Diego Comic-Con panel this year, with HBO announcing that neither ""Game of Thrones"" nor ""Westworld"" will be present at the annual fan event.

In a statement, the premium cable outlet explained that the omission of its two biggest series from Comic-Con was a purely logistical choice, noting that ""production schedules and air dates"" for the splashy series conflicted with the July event.

Here are HBO's remarks in full:

""Due to production schedules and air dates for Game of Thronesand Westworld, these series will not be presented at San Diego Comic-Con this summer. HBO has a longstanding relationship with SDCC, and we are very grateful for the fans' enthusiastic response over the years. We look forward to returning in the future.""

HBO has offered a ""Game of Thrones"" panel every year since the show's premiere. Skipping it now, ahead of the launch of the show's eighth and final season in 2019, seems more than a little anti-climactic. And while ""Westworld"" only made its Comic-Con debut last year, it seemed by all accounts poised for another buzzy panel in 2018, following all of its season two shakeups.

Of course, HBO isn't the only notable name that won't be presenting a panel in Hall H this year: Marvel is also passing on that noteworthy annual event, instead simply offering fans a floor exhibit honoring 10 years of the MCU. But according to Deadline, HBO won't even be doing that, skipping any sort of Comic-Con presence entirely (and that includes a rumored sneak peek at one of the potential ""Thrones"" spinoffs). Bummer.

Regardless of those glaring absences, Comic-Con will be overflowing with other offerings -- more information can be found here. The event runs from July 19 through July 22.

"3 Ways To Get Boho Waves Without Heat
I don’t know about you, but in the summer, the last thing I want to do is style my hair with heat. It’s just too hot to have more warmth radiating towards my head and melting off my makeup. Plus, straightening my hair with a blow dryer or flat iron is a little pointless when the humidity is so high. Instead of fighting humid conditions, I find it’s best to work with them by encouraging my own natural wave. Luckily, hair with texture, from loose barely-there waves to sexy tousled curls, is totally on trend. The look is the perfect complement to fashion’s current hippie-chic vibe and the carefree spirit of summer. Best of all, it's easy to curl your hair without heat, saving your locks from heat damage while you stay cool.

3 Ways to Curl Your Hair Without Heat

If you already have some wave to your hair, you might be able to simply scrunch in some product and allow your hair to air dry naturally. To enhance waves further or soften tighter curls, I offer three ways to get boho waves without heat. These techniques are all quick and easy, but you’ll need to allow time for your hair to set. I prefer to style damp hair in the morning and allow it to air dry, but you can also set your hair the night before and wake up to pretty waves.

Tips for Perfect Air-Dried Waves

Product is your friend. Try a sea salt spray or wave-encouraging lotion if your hair is on the straight side. Mousse or curl-defining cream should do the trick for hair with more bend. Be sure to run a frizz control product or shine serum over your ends if prone to frizz or flyaways. For extra hold and humidity protection, spritz a layer of hairspray over the set before releasing your waves.

Hair should be damp but not soaking wet, or it will take a really long time to dry. So if you are fresh from the shower, allow it to air dry a bit before styling it.

The drier your hair is when you release the set, the wavier heatless curls. I like to set my hair and then allow it ","0"

Kate, now a mother of two sons herself, told show host Jimmy Kimmel of the incident: 'Well, we thought our parents were out of town. We were old - we were a little bit old - we were teens - you know, late teens.

'My parents like to party. You know, they're very open, open-door type of family, and so that's how we felt as teenagers. We were like, ""Guys, parents are out of town. Come on over"".

'We thought it was gonna be like 20 people, but 50 of our friends were at the house, and we're having a blast - and all of a sudden, the door flings open, and it's my mother.'

She giggled, before trailing off: 'Everything just stopped. And she was in a negligee, which was really...'

"James Franco to Attend SAG Awards 2018 Amid Misconduct Scandal
James Franco will attend the 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, January 21, despite the recent sexual misconduct allegations made against him, the actor’s rep confirmed to CNN.

Related: Hollywood’s Sexual Misconduct Scandals While Hollywood may appear to be all glitz and glam on the surface, the industry has seen its fair share of scandals through the years. The New York Times and the New Yorker first published investigative pieces in 2017 that accused disgruntled movie producer Harvey Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Soon after, Weinstein stood trial and was […]

The 39-year-old is nominated for the SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for The Disaster Artist. Earlier this month, he won Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globe Awards for his role in the biographical dramedy, which chronicles the making of Tommy Wiseau’s 2003 cult film The Room.

"‘This Is Us’ Midseason Finale Reveals Nicky’s Fate – And It’s Probably Not What You Were Expecting
(Warning: This post contains spoilers for the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, titled “The Beginning Is The End Is the Beginning”)

“This Is Us” closed the first half of its third season Tuesday night by dropping multiple bombs on the audience — and please excuse us, because no war pun was intended there.

It’s just that the Pearsons’ drama came in hard and fast in the final few moments of the episode, titled “The Beginning Is The End Is the Beginning,” with the biggest shock to fans’ systems tonight arguably being the revelation that Jack Pearson’s little brother Nicky didn’t actually die in the Vietnam War.

Throughout the latest episode of the NBC series created by Dan Fogelman, we see Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) try, once again, to get through to Nicky (Michael Angarano) after the former brought the latter back to his camp in Vietnam to try to set him on the straight and narrow and get him through the rest of the time they have left to serve.

Nicky relapses and Jack swears he’s going to clean his brother up again. And as we near the end of the hour, it’s unclear what will happen to the younger Pearson man — especially since they brothers have only 48 left to spend together.

We cut back to the present day, where Kevin (Justin Hartley) and his girlfriend Zoe (Melanie Liburd) have been diving into his father and (supposedly late) uncle’s past in the small village in Vietnam where Jack was stationed.

There is a loud explosion and Jack goes running to find Nicky, with one of the soldiers noting that, “A boat exploded. I think one of our guys was on it.” Jack dives into the water and begins to swim toward a scene we can’t see.

We come back to Kevin in the present, where the translator who was helping him communicate with a local historian, mentions casually he was going to suggest something Kevin could bring home to lay on his uncle’s war memorial one day — but","0"
"Joy-Anna Duggar Gives Birth: Details on Her First Child With Husband Austin Forsyth
Party of three! Joy-Anna Duggar, 20, and her husband, Austin Forsyth, 24, welcomed their little one into the world on Feb. 23, the couple confirmed to People.

""We are blessed beyond measure with the arrival of our son, Gideon Martyn Forsyth,"" the couple told the mag. ""Looking at our child for the first time was such an incredible moment! God is so good, and we are so thankful."" He was born at 3:39 p.m., measured 22 inches long, and weighed 10 pounds, 3 ounces.

For months, rumors had been swirling that the duo — who tied the knot in May — engaged in premarital sex. However, some fans defended the couple. ""Her due date is on Feb. 22, 2017, her conception date was on June 1st, 2017, and her wedding was on May 27, 2017. If anyone have [sic] doubt just check on Google reverse conception date,"" one person wrote before another added, ""This would have happened most likely wedding night. May 26th. Like I said during the first week.""

Back in August, the couple announced they were expecting in a sweet post on Instagram. ""Austin and I are SO thankful to announce that we are parents!! Even before we were married we prayed that God would give us children and we are so blessed that he has given us this baby! Jesus is the giver of Life! The baby has arms, legs, fingers, and toes. It has a beating heart and brain waves. The baby responds to touch and is already right- or left-handed. The baby has its own unique fingerprints, which are different from anyone else's. All organ systems are in place!"" They ended the sweet post with a Bible verse.

These two are already the best parents!

“Grey’s Anatomy” stars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew are leaving the ABC drama, Variety has confirmed. The two actors will depart at the end of the show’s current and 14th season.

“The characters of Arizona and April are permanently woven into the fabric of Grey’s Anatomy thanks to the extraordinary work of Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew,” said executive producer Krista Vernof. “As writers, our job is to follow the stories where they want to go and sometimes that means saying goodbye to characters we love. It has been a joy and a privilege to work with these phenomenally talented actresses.”

“It’s always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters,” said executive producer Shonda Rhimes. “Both Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic — both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV. I will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performance and for inspiring women around the globe. They will always be a part of our Shondaland family.”

Capshaw and Drew’s departures follow the signing of series star Ellen Pompeo to a lucrative deal that will keep her with the drama franchise and pay her as much as $20 million per season.

Who Is Cameron Diaz?

Cameron Diaz began modeling at age 16 and worked in ad campaigns for Calvin Klein and Coca-Cola. Her first film role was in The Mask with Jim Carrey and she's starred in a wide array of projects since then, including the existential black comedy Being John Malkovich and the Martin Scorsese period drama Gangs of New York. Diaz also provides the voice of Princess Fiona in the Shrek films, with other humor-laden outings including Charlie's Angels, The Sweetest Thing, The Other Woman and Annie.

Early Life

'Cameron Michelle Diaz was born on August 30, 1972, in San Diego, California. The daughter of Emilio Diaz, a second-generation Cuban American oil company foreman, and his wife Billie, who is of Native American, Italian and German descent, Diaz began modeling when she was 16 years old. Her successful modeling career took her to Japan, Australia, Morocco and Paris, among other locales, and landed her in such magazines as Mademoiselle and Seventeen as well as advertising campaigns for companies like Calvin Klein, Coca-Cola and Levi's.

It all hit the fan on the final ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" reunion episode Sunday night, as Kandi Burruss finally confronted Phaedra Parks for her role in spreading a vicious rape rumor.

All season long, Burruss has been fighting allegations she and husband Todd said they wanted to drug co-star Porsha Williams and take advantage of her. Last week, Porsha revealed she first heard about it from Parks, who claimed she heard it from Kandi firsthand.

""To say I would drug somebody, there's multiple levels to that,"" an emotional Burruss said to Phaedra during the reunion. ""She, as a person who knows me, knows I don't do drugs or deal with anything with drugs, but then on top of that, as an attorney why would you repeat to say somebody would drug somebody?""

""People was under my comments with the hashtag #KandiAKABillCosby,"" she continued. ""Y'all know how much I care about my business and my brand and you're gonna sit up there and say some shit like that? It's one thing to say she messed with this person, we throw shade, whatever, but drugs?""

""You should understand that drugging somebody while they're drinking is rape,"" she added, starting to cry. ""Y'all accused me of being a f--king rapist, that is crazy. You as an attorney, why would you do that?!""

She then walked off the set.

Parks and Williams had a heated talk of their own backstage, as Porsha asked why Phaedra claimed Kandi had told her about her alleged plan.

"Rebel Wilson ordered to repay millions in defamation case
Rebel Wilson ordered to repay millions in defamation case

27 June 2018 Share Save Share Save

EPA Rebel Wilson won a defamation lawsuit against Bauer Media last year

An Australian court has ordered actress Rebel Wilson to repay the majority of her record defamation payout from a magazine publisher.

Wilson had received A$4.7m (£2.6m; $3.5m) in damages and interest from Bauer Media over articles that she said portrayed her as a serial liar.

But a court reduced the sum to A$600,000 earlier this month following an appeal by the publisher.

On Wednesday, Wilson was ordered to pay back A$4.1m and A$60,000 in interest.

She will also have to cover 80% of what Bauer spent on its appeal.

Wilson, an Australian star of Hollywood films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, has vowed to give all of her compensation to charity.

In its original finding, the Supreme Court of Victoria awarded her A$650,000 in general damages and $A3.9m for film roles she had lost out on. She was later paid A$180,000 in interest.

However the size of the payout, Australia's largest for a defamation case, was reduced significantly on appeal.

Ahead of the appeal case - which Wilson did not attend in person - the actress was keen to point out that the court was not reconsidering whether she had won her case, but merely the amount paid out.

The Victorian Court of Appeal ruled that Wilson had failed to prove that Bauer was responsible for her missing out on film roles.

"'Catfish' to Resume Filming After Nev Schulman Sexual Misconduct Claims Found 'Not Credible'
MTV has resumed production on Catfish: The Show after an investigation found that sexual misconduct claims against its host and executive producer, Nev Schulman, were ""not credible and without merit.""

In May, the reality show was put on hold after a woman who appeared on the series alleged that she was sexually harassed by Shulman throughout filming. Schulman denied the allegations.

“Although we never received a formal complaint, MTV and Critical Content immediately engaged an independent third party investigator,” MTV said in a statement to ET. “The independent investigator found the allegations made in the YouTube videos to be not credible and without merit.”

“Given the results of the investigation, Catfish will resume filming. We take these matters very seriously and are committed to providing a safe working environment,"" the statement concludes.

Schulman also took to Twitter to thank fans for having his back.

In a YouTube video posted on May 12, Ayissha Morgan, who appeared on the show in 2015, went public with her accusations, claiming that the show's ""main person"" relentlessly hit on her during production of her episode, questioned her about being a lesbian and also propositioned her for sex.

In a statement to ET at the time, an MTV spokesperson said the network was conducting an investigation, and that production on the show had been paused.

“We take these allegations very seriously,” the statement read. “We’re working with Critical Content, our third party production company, to conduct a thorough investigation, and we’ve put a pause on shooting until the investigation is completed.”

"Kylie Jenner Breaks Met Gala’s ‘No Selfie Rule’ With Kim and Brie Larson (Photo)
Kylie Jenner broke the Met Gala’s “No Selfie Rule” at the annual event on Monday night, posting an epic bathroom selfie featuring Kim Kardashian West, Lily Aldridge and Brie Larson.

According to E! Online, the “no social media” policy was implemented in 2015 but isn’t taken as seriously two years later. Sources told the publication that when the policy was first introduced it was “solely to do with guests’ security and enjoyment of the event,” not to prohibit them from documenting the annual night.

Halle Berry and Nick Jonas, for example, kept fans up to date on their night by posting Instagram stories, while Jackson shared a Snapchat photo of herself in the bathroom with Bella Hadid, Lara Stone and Ruby Rose.

In 2015, Kendall Jenner took a bathroom selfie which featured the likes of Emily Ratajkowski, Zoe Kravitz and Cara Delevingne.

"Jason Mraz Pens Touching 'I Am Bi Your Side' Love Poem to LGBTQ Fans
Musicians, actors and numerous other pop culture luminaries continue to celebrate Pride Month in their own special way.

Jason Mraz, in particular, penned a touching love poem titled ""I Am Bi Your Side,"" published by Billboard for its ""Love Letter to the LGBTQ Community"" features on Thursday.

""Dear You,

Thank you.

You have inspired me.

Re-wired me.

You showed me what strength is.

You demonstrated courage over and over again.

You risked so much for love.

You never compromised your expression

Even when

Your rights and freedoms were being compromised.

You stood up for me.

You stood up for the world.

And now the world is better because of you.

We still have a long way to go

But know

I am bi your side.

All ways.

The ""Love Someone"" crooner has always been a LGBTQ activist. During his first engagement to Tristan Prettyman in 2011 (they later broke it off six months later), the then-couple vowed to not tie the knot until gay marriage became legal. He was also the first-ever straight man on the cover of Instinct magazine in 2012, recognized for his efforts in support of LGBTQ rights.

The singer eventually went on to marry his girlfriend, Christina Carano, in October 2015, once same-sex marriage became legal in the U.S.

On Thursday, the Waitress actor also released his new single, ""Unlonely,"" which will be featured on his upcoming album, Know, set to be released on Aug.10.

'Dancing with the Stars' pros Jenna Johnson and Val Chmerkovskiy are engaged

Like brother, like brother.

Last year, Maksim Chmerkovskiy married fellow ""Dancing with the Stars"" pro Peta Murgatroyd.

Thursday, his brother, Valentin Chmerkovskiy, and his girlfriend and ""DWTS"" colleague, Jenna Johnson, announced their engagement.

In a simple, straightforward tweet from Venice, Italy, Johnson wrote: ""#ENGAGED @iamValC,"" which is Chmerkovskiy's Twitter handle.

But it's the two accompanying pictures that really stir the emotions.

In the first one, a shocked Johnson stands with her hands over her mouth as Chmerkovskiy kneels to propose, his hand extended while holding a ring. We can figure out her answer even without the tweet's text in the next photo, as Johnson leans down to kiss her brand new fiance.

Chmerkovskiy shared his sentiments in another tweet: ""I can't wait to make you my wife.""

Is wearing black to the Golden Globes in protest of sexual harassment really that big of a deal?

Because Sunday's Golden Globes is taking place in a nation is reeling from #MeToo disclosures, the women — and men — attending the annual 75th annual Hollywood awards ceremony have decided to do something they think will be special: Wear black to show their disdain for sexual harassment and misconduct, as well as to support its victims.

After all, Hollywood has, albeit unwittingly, played a huge role establishing nation's new anti-harassment sentiment. Which was brought on by the #MeToo movement. Which gained steam after a New York Times investigation, and a follow-up by The New Yorker, documented years and years of alleged sexual harassment and assault by one of their own: Oscar-winning producer Harvey Weinstein.

Since then, a number of powerful men in the arts, entertainment, media, restaurant and political industries have been similarly accused and, in some cases, fired from their jobs.

Its true, actors and actresses — many of whom have gone to great lengths to distance themselves from Weinstein lest, perhaps, their own careers be ruined — have the visibility and audience that allows them to deliver messages to millions of people.

And yet, I can't figure out how wearing black to the Golden Globes will send any sort of powerful message.

It doesn't seem like much of an effort — in fact it seems rather business-as-usual. Plenty of people already wear black to the event.

Last year, Amy Adams, Mandy Moore, Winona Ryder, Kathryn Hahn, Blake Lively, Kristen Bell and Meryl Streep were among those who chose what InStyle magazine gushingly dubbed ""not so basic black."" In fact, black was such a popular choice ABC News declared on its website that ""Black is Back on the Red Carpet."" Several women, including Streep, said they will wear black again on Sunday.

'Yeah, that's... uh troubling, isn't it?' the Miami Vice legend told Digital Spy jokingly, before adding, 'No, she's a big girl, she can handle herself.'

Fatherly love: Don Johnson joked about daughter Dakota Johnson's rumored relationship with Chris Martin (pictured February 2016)

Dakota, whose Don's daughter with second wife Melanie Griffith, has been seen in various parts of the world including Israel with the rocker.

They were most recently spotted together while on a date in Malibu.

A source told US Weekly that they 'are definitely dating' in December.

Chris was previously married to actress Gwyneth Paltrow from 2003 to 2016, and together they have daughter Apple, 13, and son Moses, 11.

"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood News, Casting, Release Date
The casting couldn't be more perfect: quintessential Hollywood good guy Tom Hanks will play beloved children's television star Fred Rogers in a new biopic about the television pioneer. Here's what we know so far.

A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is loosely based on journalist Tom Junod's 1998 Esquire profile of Rogers.

It will center around how ""a cynical journalist begrudgingly accepts an assignment to write a profile piece on the beloved icon and finds his perspective on life transformed,"" according to Variety, which first broke the news back in January.

Watch the first trailer from the film, which previews the plot, up top.

Junod is a fan of Hanks playing Rogers.

""The really cool thing about Tom Hanks playing Fred is that Fred and Tom Hanks are similar in a really essential way in that they are gentle people, they are soft spoken people, but they are powerful people,"" he told Esquire. ""I think that Tom Hanks can really bring that aspect of Fred out.""

Sony

The script for the film was written by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster.

Marielle Heller, who is perhaps best known for Diary of a Teenage Girl, will direct.



""As a mother, I am so inspired by the teachings of Fred Rogers and as a human I am in awe of his life’s work,"" Heller said. ""I can’t wait to bring his story to the public and be a part of such a thoughtful, smart group of people who are all coming together to make this film, which truly feels to me like an antidote to our very fractured culture.""



Other members of the cast include Matthew Rhys, Susan Kelechi Watson, and Chris Cooper, and the film, which was previously titled You Are My Friend, will premiere in November of this year.

The project will serve as something of a follow-up to the documentary Won't You Be My Neighbor.

That film premiered in 2018, just in time for the 50th anniversary of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.

U2 presented Bruno Mars with the award for album of the year. Mars said to the other album of the year nominees, ""You guys are the reason I'm in the studio pulling my hair out, because I know you will only come with top shelf artistry.""

He continued and talked about being a 15-year-old performer.

""Those songs I was singing were written by either Babyface, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis or Teddy Riley,"" he said as he explained that those were the artists who got people around the world dancing. ""They are my heroes. They are my teachers and the foundation."" Mars said he hopes to get everyone in the world dancing.

"This McDonald's french fry fork is infuriatingly stupid
There is absolutely nothing good or right with this new creation from McDonald’s.

McDonald's just unveiled its new invention: the ""Frork,"" a fork made of French fries https://t.co/oc6goZ9PW9 pic.twitter.com/HKKvhcdisU — NBC News (@NBCNews) May 1, 2017

The fast-food promotion is one of the greatest cultural gifts America gave the world. Most of us don’t get to experience what seasonal produce some chef named Serge is offering at a Michelin-starred restaurant, but darn it if I can’t go to Hardee’s and eat a burger with some weird boneless ribs on it that were marketed on Shark Tank (yes, this is a thing).

These limited-time offers are where fast food gets weird, and when fast food gets weird, it gets fun. There are a couple of basic rules for running a good promotion.

Did you cram more crap on your food? Why didn’t you cram more crap on your food?

That’s it. It’s simple. What McDonald’s has done with this whole “frork” fiasco is asked me to change my eating habits. It makes no damn sense. This is the veil being pulled off corporate America. Some dude in a $5,000 suit named “Todd,” probably with a “Jr.” or “III” on the end of his name, was looking for brownie points by saying: “You know, I think America wants an edible fork.”

NO I DON’T WANT A DAMN EDIBLE FORK, TODD. I WANT TO CRAM THE FOOD INTO MY MOUTH CHUTE WITH MY UNWASHED HANDS BEFORE BLOWING MY NOSE ON THE GREASE-COVERED BAG AND SHAMEFULLY REALIZING I FINISHED AN ENTIRE MEAL AT A STOP LIGHT AND THEN SEEING THAT THE PERSON IN THE CAR NEXT TO ME VIDEO’D ALL THIS. THAT’S WHAT I WANT, TODD.

The frork appeals to a very limited part of the fast food Venn diagram, all of whom are idiots. It’s people who want to keep their hands clean while eating, but also who want to get grease all over their fingers while they cram greasy fries into a fork-shaped holder.

GOD, TODD, I SWEAR I HATE YOU SO MUCH.

She admitted that Doak “is the first person I’ve ever thought about wanting to spend the rest of my life with because he makes not just me but the girls happy too and that’s what matters the most so hopefully one day he will give me the commitment I am looking for and wanting for quite some time or at least put some kind of ring on it.”

While Shannon, 39, is ready to have a ring on her finger, she realizes that Doak has some nerves about proposing.

“A girl can always dream I know that he is scared but at this point I am honestly looking to take that next step in our relationship,” she said. “It really hurt me to actually say either step up or I’m going to have to walk away but I know my girls want the best for me and I know that he is little scared as he was married for many years and I am only his second serious relationship his whole entire life.”

Although Doak is nervous about popping the question, Shannon is hopeful that it will happen.

Netflix introduces season 2 of gripping thriller 'The Sinner'

The Sinner season two is currently streaming on Netflix now. All eight episodes dropped on Netflix this morning (Friday, August 3) at 8am, so fans of the thriller series are able to binge-watch over the weekend. But unfortunately, there is no sign of Jessica Biel in The Sinner season two.

WARNING: This article contains spoilers about The Sinner season one. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT You can sign up to a month free trial of Netflix to watch seasons one and two of The Sinner. Afterwards, you can subscribe for £5.99 per month. Season one followed the story Cora Tannetti played by Jessica Biel, which is also available to stream and download on Netflix now. Biel was nominated for a Golden Globe for best actress in a miniseries for her portrayal of Cora in season one of The Sinner. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST SERIES OF THE SINNER?

Jessica Biel will not star in The Sinner season 2

Cora randomly stabs a man to death on the beach and Detective Harry Ambrose (played by Bill Pullman) takes on her case, trying to figure out why she has done it. The plot of season one was a one ended story, with Cora receiving two years in a psychiatric facility, avoiding a 30-year jail sentence. Therefore, season two sees Detective Harry Ambrose take on a brand new case, involving a double murder in his hometown of Keller, New York. This means Jessica Biel does not appear in the new series of The Sinner. Instead, she continues as Executive Producer on the show. Speaking to Variety, Biel said: “We did talk a lot about does Cora come back for season two and what is the relationship because that's what was interesting to me. “What happens when a woman goes through that? What is life like after that when the only person really in her life that she can connect with, even besides her husband, is the detective who ","0"

"Harry and Meghan’s Wedding Will Be Very Different From William and Kate’s
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are set to have the wedding of the year this coming spring, but don’t expect their royal affair to be a copy of Prince William and Duchess Kate’s 2011 ceremony. Here’s what we know so far about how the wedding will be different.

On Tuesday, Kensington Palace announced that the wedding will take place in May 2018 at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle. The Queen has approved the venue, and the royal family will pay for the wedding.

St. George’s Chapel contains the tombs of 10 royals, including Henry VIII and his third wife, Jane Seymour. At least three services take place there every day, and all are open to the public. Windsor Castle, where the Queen lives for part of every year, is located about 20 miles west of London. ""Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half,"" Kensington Palace said in a statement. Harry himself was christened there in 1984, so by the rules of the Church of England, he can be married there.

Though William and Kate were married in Westminster Abbey in 2011 and Prince Charles and Princess Diana were married at St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1981, Harry's wedding won’t be the first time a recent royal has married at St. George’s. According to NBC News, Harry’s uncle, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones there in 1999, and his cousin, Peter Phillips, married Autumn Kelly at the chapel in 2008. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles had a televised religious blessing there after they had a civil wedding ceremony nearby in 2005.

Doria Ragland was the only member of Meghan Markle's side of the family to attend the royal wedding, but the mother of the bride did not mind sitting alone as she watched her daughter marry Prince Harry.

Ragland, who wore a stunning pastel green Oscar de la Renta dress and coat (designed by creative directors Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia), took her seat in the second row of one of the side pews inside St. George's Chapel, where Markle and Harry's wedding took place Saturday.

Her seat was reportedly right across from Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who sat beside her husband, Prince Philip.



Cameras captured Ragland as she was overcome with emotion throughout the ceremony, particularly when Markle and Harry exchanged their vows.

On social media, people commended Markle's mother for attending and sitting at the wedding alone. Ragland and Markle's father, Thomas Markle Sr., divorced in 1987, and it was announced that he was unable to attend the wedding after suffering a heart attack earlier this week.

""Beautifiully [sic] dressed Doria sitting alone in such a beautiful historical moment shows strength, & grace that must be an inspiration to Meghan,"" one user wrote. ""This is the reality of many single parents.""

""Kudos to #DoriaRagland for sitting there alone representing,"" another said. ""It can't be easy with all that pressure and scrutiny.""

Royal expert Alastair Bruce spoke with Town and Country leading up to the nuptials, and explained how much input Markle and Harry have in deciding who gets invited and who sits where at the wedding.



""It’s very much a matter for the bride and the groom,"" Bruce said, adding that the couple enlists the help of The Lord Chamberlain's Office when deciding the seating chart. ""They will assist him. They know the layout of St. George’s Chapel, and they will guide him.""

"Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande split: what happens to the ring?
The greatest love story of our time 2018 has ended, TMZ reports. Pop singer Ariana Grande and Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson called off their engagement over the weekend, leaving many, many people wondering who will get custody of their pet pig, what they will do about their matching tattoos, and, most pressingly, what will become of the $93,000 pear-shaped diamond ring that Davidson bought for Grande.

People on Twitter were fixated specifically on the question of whether Davidson would be able to get the ring back, since it cost so very much. They didn’t have to waste away in limbo for long: TMZ reported in the wee hours of Tuesday morning that Grande had already returned it. But, clearly, this situation was about a lot more than a diamond ring.

Who?

Famous people get together and break up all the time, so it’s important to know that this isn’t just any celebrity romance. Grande and Davidson’s relationship captivated onlookers because of its speed, intensity, and incredibly public nature. It was also surprising, since Grande is, well, much more famous than Davidson.

They got together in late May, shortly after breaking up with partners they dated for multiple years — the rapper Mac Miller and Cazzie David, Larry David’s daughter, respectively — and fanned the flames of the public’s interest by flirting via Instagram comments. They got numerous tattoos for one another. After roughly one month of dating, they were engaged.

The usual rites of courtship happened at warp speed, magnified by Grande and Davidson’s visibility and collective wealth. They adopted a pig and named it Piggy Smalls. They moved into a $16 million apartment in New York together. Grande titled the penultimate song on her album Sweetener “pete davidson” — not something most people do in a relationship, but notable nonetheless.

It all seemed so unwise! So soon! But also ... so fun, a spectacle played out on social m","0"
"Katy Perry Breaks Down in Shockingly Honest Therapy Session as She Opens Up About Past Suicidal Thoughts
Katy Perry gave fans witness to an emotional and raw therapy session on Friday night, where she discussed everything from her past struggles with her identity to the real motivation behind her pixie haircut.

The 32-year-old pop star has been livestreaming her life on her personal YouTube channel for the entire weekend as part of the release of her brand new “purposeful pop” album, Witness,showing everything she’s doing in the Los Angeles residence where she’s set up camp — from meditation and yoga classes to dance parties and evening sleeps.

On Friday, that included a tearful no-holds barred chat with Dr. Siri Sat Nam Singh, host of Viceland’s The Therapist, which airs every Monday at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT. Together, the two discussed Perry’s desire to be live an more genuine life — something she’d been inspired to do after drawing an “authenticity” card from a desk of inspirational Angel Cards in the wake of her last album, 2013’s Prism.

Katy Perry/Youtube

Attempting to leave behind the heightened pop persona that catapulted the “California Girls” singer into stardom, Perry told Dr. Singh that she often feels divided between “Katy Perry, pop star” and “Katheryn Hudson,” the “dork” her family and close friends know.

The dichotomy is part of the reason Perry decided to embark on such a drastic pixie haircut. “I didn’t want to look like Katy Perry anymore,” she said — adding that the haircut had provoked hate and abuse from users on social media.

“I’m a bit more nerdy than everybody thinks I am, I’m a big goofball. The fantasy of Katheryn went into Katy and made this bigger than life personality,” Perry said, Australia’s News Corp reported. “That’s the point of this whole thing, if people can see I’m just like them then they can dream just as big,”

"‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’: We’ve Got an Update on That Whole Broadway Musical Thing
“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” star Rachel Bloom and series creator Aline Brosh McKenna just gave reporters an update on that whole Broadway musical adaptation thing they were apparently working on.

“‘Twas a bit premature on my part,” Bloom admitted of her February Instagram announcement, when she touted meetings in New York City for the stage version of their CW show. “It’s not not happening. It’s just, you know, Broadway’s hard.”

“We’ve talked a lot about it and we kind of took a first round of meetings to explore that universe,” McKenna added at Monday’s Television Critics Association press tour. “We’re busy figuring out this end of the TV chapter, but we are definitely intending to do a play.”

“I just wanted the ‘Likes’ on Instagram,” Bloom said. She got more than 11,000 for the effort, which our readers can see below.

“Bathroom selfie with @abmck [McKenna] on this Galentines Day,” Bloom’s Instagram post read. “We’re celebrating it by doing our first round of NYC meetings for the ‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’ Broadway musical. Coming to Broadway in probably 2150 because that’s how Broadway works I think.”

Here’s the post that accompanied that caption:

Earlier during the TCA panel, Bloom and McKenna explained the odd-but-apparently-creative choice to recast Santino Fontana’s role of Greg in favor of new star Skylar Astin.

“When Rachel and I were conceiving the show we had always sort of intended that Greg and Rebecca’s romance would end sort of where it did,” McKenna said.

But much like the show has continued to explore the character of Josh despite the end of his romance with Rebecca, McKenna and Bloom wanted to find new ways to incorporate Greg despite Fontana’s departure at the beginning of Season 2.

“Rachel and I had always been exploring bringing back that character and sort of trying to figure out a way to do it that suited our show,” McKenna continued. “So now bringing the character of","0"

Show Caption Hide Caption Abby Lee Miller shares how she's spending her last days of freedom Abby Lee Miller is spending her finals days of freedom surrounded by friends. The 'Dance Moms' star opened up about life just four days before starting her 366 day prison sentence. USA TODAY

Former Dance Moms reality star Abby Lee Miller checked into federal prison Wednesday in Victorville, Calif., about a two-hour drive from Los Angeles.

More than a year after pleading guilty at federal court in Pittsburgh, Miller has reported to the FCI Victorville facility to begin serving her 366-day sentence. In May, she was sentenced for bankruptcy fraud and bringing $120,000 worth of Australian currency into the country without reporting it.

In addition to prison time, a federal judge also ordered her to pay a $40,000 fine and spend two years on probation after her release.

In the case, prosecutors said Miller was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy when she tried to hide $775,000 worth of income from her Lifetime network reality show and its spinoffs.

The investigation began when a channel-surfing bankruptcy judge saw Miller on TV in December 2012 and figured she had to be making more than the $8,899 in monthly income she was claiming.

Entertainment Tonight caught up with Miller at a red-carpet event in Los Angeles on Saturday night, when she talked about her pending imprisonment.

""I'll just have me to concentrate on and that’s different,"" she told Entertainment Tonight. ""I’ve always put everybody else’s child first, before my own health, before my own outfit, before my own time frame. Everybody else was dressed and out the door and looking perfect and I was running around trying to find a clean towel to take a shower with, so I think this will be a little 'me' time.""

"Shannon Beador Gives Update on Divorce, David Beador

The last time we saw Shannon at the Season 12 RHOC reunion, she had announced that she and her husband, David Beador, had separated after 17 years of marriage. This season of RHOC kicks off as Shannon is in the midst of divorce proceedings with David. She officially filed for divorce from David on December 1, 2017.

Even though Shannon is still going through the process of divorce today, she said she is in a much better place than when we last saw her during that emotionally raw reunion. ""Life today at this very moment couldn't be better. I am honestly happy. And it's not me trying to convince anybody that I'm happy. I'm happy,"" she told The Daily Dish during an interview in New York City Monday. ""I pinch myself sometimes. I'm so grateful and blessed for the things that are going on in my life and for the people that I have in my life right now. So things are very good.""

It took Shannon some time and a lot of soul searching to get to this positive place. ""After the reunion when we officially announced the separation, it was difficult for me because even though we had been separated for a little over a month, it had become public, and now everybody knew about it. It just made it real to me,"" she said. ""So there was a long period of sadness and a lot of tears and a lot of pain. And I had to process through that pain. And I think that I emerged from it by literally staying home and learning to be happy with myself, that I came out a stronger person. And I know that whether I found another partner or not, I'm gonna be OK standing on my own. It's all a blessing.""

While Teigen and husband John Legend were filming their holiday special A Legendary Christmas over Halloween time, their 2½-year-old daughter Luna Simone was “so confused” because she was expecting a bit of a different kind of seasonal celebration at the time.

“She did trick-or-treating at Universal Studios to celebrity trailers,” recalled the mother of two. “She had no idea what was happening. She still asks for Halloween. It was so weird. Honestly, [she was] probably very lucky to do that.”

"‘Kevin Can Wait’s’ Erinn Hayes was killed off. Now a new show could help sitcom wives take revenge.
It’s been a little over a year since “Kevin Can Wait” killed off Erinn Hayes’s character after just one season, a very weird move, given that she played a lead character — Donna Gable, Kevin’s wife of 20 years. To add fuel to the fire burning inside upset viewers' hearts, the CBS sitcom replaced Hayes with Leah Remini, Kevin James’s former co-star from “King of Queens.” Ratings took a dip, and the network eventually axed the show in May.

Donna, while a high-profile case, wasn’t the only mistreated wife in sitcom history, and this hasn’t gone unnoticed. AMC Networks announced Friday that it has a project in development called “Kevin Can F*** Himself,” from creator Valerie Armstrong and executive producers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack.

The series aims to expose “the secret life of a woman we all grew up watching: the sitcom wife,” the network said in a statement. “A beauty paired with a less attractive, dismissive, caveman-like husband who gets to be a jerk because she’s a nag and he’s ‘funny.'"" The show aims to illuminate said secret life by switching between “single-camera realism and multi-camera zaniness.”

Hayes even tweeted about it:

This project is the second buzzed about this week that directly challenges long-established Hollywood tropes. The first? “Isn’t It Romantic,” an upcoming movie that centers on a cynical woman (Rebel Wilson) who faces her worst nightmare when she gets trapped in a cheesy romantic comedy. (Yes, the same movie Wilson was promoting when she incorrectly claimed to be the “first-ever plus-sized girl” to lead a rom-com.)

AMC opened a writers' room for the sitcom — as well as workplace drama “Rainy Day People” — under its “script-to-series” development model, used for projects with promising pilot scripts.

Ariana Grande has written a letter to her fans in the wake of the tragedy at her concert in Manchester this week, where 22 people were killed by a suicide bomber.

In the essay shared on her Instagram and Twitter accounts, Ariana revealed she’s planning a benefit concert in Manchester to honour the victims and raise money for their families.

“My heart, prayers, and deepest condolences are with the victims of the Manchester Attack and their loved ones. There is nothing I or anyone can do to take away the pain you are feeling or to make this better,” she began. “However, I extend my hand and heart and everything I possibly can give to you and yours, should you want or need my help in any way. The only thing we can do now is choose how we let this affect us and how we live our lives from here on out.”

“I am sorry for the pain and fear that you must be feeling and for the trauma that you, too, must be experiencing,” she continued.

“We will never be able to understand why events like this take place because it is not in our nature, which is why we shouldn’t recoil. We will not quit or operate in fear. We won’t let this divide us. We won’t let hate win.”

Grande then revealed her plans to return to Manchester to perform a benefit concert.

“I don’t want to go the rest of the year without being able to see and hold and uplift my fans, the same way they continue to uplift me. Our response to this violence must be to come closer together, to help each other, to love more, to sing louder and to live more kindly and generously than we did before,” she said.

Jennifer Aniston will be there for you when you need more info on her upcoming Apple TV show with Reese Witherspoon. In a recent interview, Aniston teased new details of her and Witherspoon's show which will tackle morning TV. And while Aniston didn't say too much about the series, she certainly said enough to get fans excited for what it could be.

When talking with Entertainment Tonight on the red carpet for her upcoming Netflix movie Dumplin', Aniston was unsurprisingly tightlipped about the untitled Apple drama, which has already been picked up for two seasons. To be fair, she admitted that the experience of working with Witherspoon, who played her little sister on Friends, has left her rather speechless. Still, she managed to throw in a few intriguing adjectives about the show that will keep fans busy for a little while.

""I just keep pinching myself, from this to that I just don't know what to say,"" Aniston said about working on the series right after working with Witherspoon's old pal Dolly Parton on Dumplin'. ""We started shooting about a month ago and it has been just so much fun. It is hard, it is dense, but it is so fulfilling.""

Hard, dense, fulfilling. Three words that might not mean much now, but give fans a lot to think about. Especially, with what has already been revealed about the show, which is slated to premiere sometime next year on Apple's new streaming service.

"Danny Amendola reportedly couldn't handle Olivia Culpo's lifestyle
Danny Amendola reportedly couldn't handle Olivia Culpo's lifestyle

Olivia Culpo was a New England Patriots fan long before she met and fell in love with Danny Amendola, so perhaps the death knell sounded on their relationship when he joined the rival Miami Dolphins. Everyone of a certain age who grew up in New England had a dad or an uncle with a fading ""Squish the Fish"" t-shirt from 1986 -- and it can be difficult to shake those cultural ties.

Of course, the more likely scenario is that the two grown adults found their relationship untenable for a variety of reasons that had less to do with the uniform he now wears and more to do with the fact that they're now based in two different cities.

Danny Amendola continues to be 'really happy' to be a Miami Dolphin

A source told Us Weekly that ""[the breakup] had to do with the distance and them barely seeing each other"" because Culpo had no intention of moving to Miami, adding that he wasn't thrilled with her nude photo shoot in Sports Illustrated.

Another source who spoke with E! News compounded the drama, claiming that Amendola was unhappy with Olivia's life choices.

Via Eonline.com:

""Danny couldn't handle Olivia's demanding lifestyle and wasn't pleased with certain choices she was making,"" says the source. ""The constant travel was also causing a rift.""

Culpo, a Rhode Island native who rose to fame after being crowned Miss USA and then Miss Universe in 2012, lives in the Northeast and has a very busy career as a model. Amendola is an NFL wide receiver. The fact that the two made it as long as they did was a miracle, honestly.

At least we'll always have this iconic moment:

NeNe Leakes is slamming Real Housewives of Atlanta costar Kim Zolciak-Biermann‘s daughter Brielle Biermann over claims of “prejudice” after the mother-daughter pair visited Leakes’ home and allegedly found cockroaches.

On Thursday, Leakes, 49, shared her response to an old video that showed the 20-year-old Don’t Be Tardy reality star in her bathroom with what appeared to be black bugs.

“On the way back to the A, I fell asleep thinking about how imma live in my ROACH infested brand new home,” Leakes captioned a selfie during a flight back from a trip to Barcelona, Spain, with the cryptic hashtag #pottymouthtrashychildren as well as #jealousprejudicebitch and #blackpeopleneedtostopsupportingtheprejudice.

In addition, Leakes shared the recently resurfaced video of Brielle on her own Instagram account, this time bringing up Kylie Jenner‘s name.

“@briellebiermann We don’t have roaches! If you found 1, u brought it with u or it fell outta yo funky p—-! Please know I will get You all the way together when you start f—ing with me and mine!” Leakes wrote in the comments section.

"Carrie Underwood’s Husband Mike Fisher Sings Ugly to ‘Cry Pretty’
Carrie Underwood posted a hilarious video of her husband, hockey player Mike Fisher, trying to sing to her new hit single “Cry Pretty” Saturday.

While driving around, Fisher did his best to hit the same notes his wife hits in the song, but failed spectacularly. “No, no, no, no, no, nononono noooooo,” he wails behind the wheel.

Videos by PopCulture.com

“You going to start your new career as a country singer, babe?” Underwood asks from the passenger seat.

“I’ve heard that many times,” Fisher says before going back to singing “Nooooo.”

There was at least one person in the car who appreciated the scene. Their son, Isaiah Michael Fisher, is heard laughing hysterically in the background.

“Sounds just like the original,” Underwood wrote in the caption, adding a zany face emoji.

Fans loved the funny video, especially Isiah’s laughing in the back.

“Hahaha. Too funny. The giggling from backseat is priceless,” one wrote.

“Love hearing that sweet giggle,” added another.

Underwood shared the adorable family moment the same weekend they celebrated Fisher’s birthday. He turned 38 on Tuesday, but they waited until the weekend since Underwood was busy at the CMA Music Festival. He got a special hat-shaped cake that read “Catchin’ Deers.”

The singer also performed at the CMT Awards on Tuesday, belting out “Cry Pretty” while wearing glitter around her eyes to recreate the song’s single art.

“Cry Pretty” is the title track of Underwood’s sixth studio album. The song was written with The Love Junkies, made up of Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna and Liz Rose.

“The first single is a song I love so much and can’t wait to share with you,” Underwood said in a statement in April. “The title refers to when emotions take over and you just can’t hold them back. It really speaks to a lot of things that have happened in the past year and I hope when you hear it, you can relate those feelings to those times in your life. It","0"

Details about “This Is Us” plots are guarded as if they’re state secrets. But Regina King, who directed an episode in the upcoming season, offered a tiny glimpse of what’s to come.

“I think there’s one thing I can tell you without getting into trouble with NBC,” she said during E!’s red carpet coverage. “In my episode, you get to meet the ‘Big Three’ in a decade that you’ve never seen them before.”

Hmm, you don’t say? “This Is Us,” the college years, maybe? Let the guesswork begin.

King won a best supporting actress two years in a row for “American Crime,” and she’s back again as a nominee.

“It was a little disappointing,” she said about the show’s recent cancellation, “but, look, we got an opportunity to do some really great storytelling for three seasons.”","0"
"Harrison Ford turns into real-life hero at the scene of an accident
Harrison Ford channeled his inner Han Solo when he rushed to the rescue of a woman who crashed her car in California on Sunday.

The “Star Wars” actor was driving east on a freeway near Santa Barbara when the female driver in front of him lost control of her ride, swerved off the road and smashed into an embankment, according to TMZ.

Ford switched into action-hero mode — slamming on his brakes and swooping in to help.

Sporting his own version of a superhero costume — a sensible button-down shirt and sunglasses — the 75-year-old star bolted to her gray sedan.

He and other good Samaritans then pulled her from the car as paramedics arrived, a witness told the celebrity news site.

The lucky lady was transported from the site of the accident, on California State Route 126, to a hospital.

She suffered only minor injuries, law-enforcement sources told the site.

It’s not the first time the actor has played a noble role off screen.

In September, a Midtown tunnel pile-up cause his Mercedes Benz to get stuck between cars, so he hopped out and began directing traffic, video footage shows.

Ford was also recently the victim of an accident himself when engine trouble forced him to land his private plane on a golf course in Santa Monica in 2015.

The Oscar-nominated actor has appeared in movies such as “Indiana Jones,” “Patriot Games” and “The Fugitive.”","0"

And now for the most random clash of celebrity worlds of the day…

Chrissy Teigen is well-known of course for ruling Twitter (including expressing her views on Naked Attraction, expressing her abhorrence at being constantly tagged in John Legend baby lookalike pictures, and telling fans what really happened when hubby John Legend once tried to break up with her).

Now she has won the social media platform again, this time with help from a partner in crime, who just happens to be a Muppet (literally).

She recently asked people to share the tattoo they used to want more than anything but are glad they didn’t go through with.

"Meghan Markle Makes Her Royal Ascot Debut in Monochrome Givenchy
Since returning from her honeymoon just over a week ago, Meghan Markle has been keeping up an extremely busy schedule, as she checks off a whole slew of “firsts” in her new role as the Duchess of Sussex. She’s handled Trooping the Colour, as well as her first “off-site” day trip with the Queen, and on Tuesday, Meghan arrived at her first Royal Ascot, the formal carriage procession that marks the beginning of a five-day racing extravaganza in Berkshire.

Meghan arrived for the festivities in a carriage along with Prince Harry (donning a top hat), Prince Edward, and Countess Sophie, with Meghan spotted “sharing a joke” with Sophie as they made their way onto the premises. (It’s always amusing how even the slightest whispered aside at these events, when everyone is watching, become used as proof of a great convivial bond.)

Meghan again wore a Givenchy look, after working with the designer for both her wedding and her dress for her day with the Queen. And, as she has for nearly all her major events since becoming a royal, Meghan decided to wear a dress in the white-cream-beige family, as she chose a white collared dress, accessorized with a white and black Philip Treacy hat. (A royal correspondent for The Sun deemed the look “Audrey Hepburn-esque.”)

The Queen—in bright yellow—rode into the Ascot with Princess Anne, both no doubt in good spirits following the birth of Zara Phillips’s second daughter yesterday, another great-grandchild for the Queen and granddaughter for Princess Anne.

"Tyrese Gibson Calls Joint Custody Ruling a ‘Win’ for His Daughter
Following a court ruling awarding him joint custody of his 10-year-old daughter Shayla with ex-wife Norma, Tyrese Gibson is now speaking out and calling the ruling a “win” for his only child.

Taking to Instagram on Saturday, the Fast & Furious actor shared several snapshots of him and his daughter, writing how the ruling was “not a win for me,” but rather “for our daughter, Shayla.”

Videos by PopCulture.com

“[She] has been exposed to tension, private and public embarrassment and growing up and feeling torn between 2 parents who are no longer married,” Gibson wrote.

“It is a win because she gets to spend equal time with both of her parents in joint legal custody while she continues to grow in a happy and healthy environment – this has always been and will continue to be my priority,” he said.

Gibson goes on to share that he has been “the best father” in the past 10 years and while facing “false accusations” by Norma, he has been “thrusted into unexpected social media storms all while trying to fight for my career and stay afloat financially.”

For weeks, Gibson and his estranged wife Norma have been catapulted into the spotlight, with young Shayla watching. On Friday, a request by Norma for a restraining order against Gibson was denied, according to The Blast.

The judge ruled that there was not an ongoing pattern of harassment by Gibson against Norma. Afterwards, the judge cleared the courtroom so the parties could discuss the pair’s daughter, Shayla.

In October, Gibson was under investigation by the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services, but the case was clsoed without pressing any charges.","0"

"Ivanka Trump
American businesswoman (born 1981)

For her mother, see Ivana Trump

Ivana Marie ""Ivanka"" Trump ( ; born October 30, 1981) is an American businesswoman. She is the second child of Donald Trump, the president of the United States, and his first wife, Ivana. Trump was a senior advisor in her father's first administration (2017–2021), and also the director of the Office of Economic Initiatives and Entrepreneurship.

Born and raised in Manhattan, Trump attended the Chapin School and later Choate Rosemary Hall. She pursued higher education at Georgetown University before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, where she graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2004.

Trump converted to Judaism prior to marrying Jared Kushner, a real estate developer, in 2009. The couple has three children. Prior to her political career, she was an executive vice president of her family-owned Trump Organization and also a boardroom judge on her father's television show, The Apprentice. She also had a fashion lifestyle brand under her own name that consisted of apparel, footwear, handbags, jewelry, and fragrance. Trump shut down the company in July 2018.

In January 2017, Trump became an unofficial advisor in her father's first presidential administration alongside her husband. In March that year, she became an official employee in his administration. While serving in the White House, she continued to retain ownership of businesses. This raised ethics concerns, specifically conflicts of interest.

Early life and education

Ivana Marie Trump was born on October 30, 1981,[1][2] in Manhattan, New York City, as the second child of Donald Trump and his first wife, the Czech-American model Ivana (née Zelníčková).[3][4] For most of her life, she has been nicknamed ""Ivanka"", a Slavic diminutive form of her first name Ivana.[5] Trump's parents divorced in 1990 when she was nine years old.[6] She has two full brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, a half-sister, Tiff","0"

"Kim Kardashian slammed for 'ridiculous' bikini Instagram: 'You should be ashamed!'
Kim Kardashian garnered a mix reaction with her latest racy Instagram post.

The KKW Beauty founder shared another photo of herself on Friday rocking a teeny vintage Chanel black-and-white bikini that left little to the imagination, and her 118 million Instagram followers' reactions were completely divided. Some people -- including some of her famous pals -- praised the star for her svelte physique, while others called her out and questioned why she felt the need to share the skin-baring snap.

""Same,"" Amy Schumer commented. ""This body is giving us life!!"" her best friend, Simon Huck, posted. ""That's hot,"" Paris Hilton said.

Others weren't as friendly.

""This is ridiculous,"" one user wrote. ""This lady really loves attention. This is not normal.""

See the photo in the gallery below:



""I don't [really] do this, but this time I feel like I must. What point really, showing off a body that is not made of anything but plastic,"" someone else sounded off. ""And for what for strangers to look at? Save it for your man instead. It's really sad and that's a call for desperate need of attention. You have three beautiful kids and a man that loves you. Be aware of your choices. You should be ashamed.""

Someone else noted that it was ""time to unfollow Kim.""

Of course, Kardashian has made a career out of exhibiting polarizing behavior, especially on social media where she tends to share her most boundary-pushing content. Judging from her past habits, she likely won't react to the criticism that she received for the photo that she posted on Friday -- she can't be bothered!

"Ryan Reynolds And Blake Lively’s Pastoral New York Paradise
Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively stay busy. Ryan’s sequel to the wildly successful Deadpool franchise drops more wisecracking mayhem into theatres everywhere next week.

Blake continues to act in films while being a health and style icon for legions of fans. The mother of two consistently looks fabulous whether in $2 million worth of jewels at the Met Gala or strolling home in her sneakers from a Westchester gym.

When they do manage to escape the seemingly endless press junkets and paparazzi shutterfests, Ryan and Blake recoup and re-center their family on 1.8 acres of a bucolic garden estate in Pound Ridge, NY.

When Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively enjoy the country life, they’re not cleaning chicken coops and milking dairy cows. Picture Martha Stewart cottage living. Seriously, Martha is actually the couple’s neighbor and a homemaker mentor to Blake.

The glamorous couple purchased the 4,753-square-foot home that sits an hour’s drive from Midtown Manhattan in 2012 for $2.35 million. Maybe it had something to do with the two pink dogwoods perfectly framing the home’s sunny yellow sloping peak that sealed the deal.

There’s plenty of luxury details built into this country house. Two private dressing rooms off the master, french doors leading out to a covered porch, a custom stone terrace overlooking the water, and a two-bedroom guest suite, are just some of the unique features that give this place its character.

The lush grounds provide amazing views of the Cross River Reservoir during the day, while Ryan and Blake can cozy up to one of the three fireplaces spread out over gleaming hardwoods on those chilly upstate nights.

Blake Lively is unashamedly domestic–her Instagram will attest to the fact that she uses every inch of her country kitchen to whip up tasty home-style family feasts.

"WWE Star Naomi Keeps It Real When It Comes to Showing Her Marriage on ‘Total Divas’
It’s hard to believe SmackDown Live superstar Naomi is approaching a decade working with WWE. And her husband Jonathan Fatu, known to fans as Jimmy Uso, has been there for most of the way as she transformed from former Orlando Magic dancer into pro-wrestling champion. Their relationship continues to be chronicled on the E! reality show Total Divas.

“Where we were in our lives 10 years ago is a lot different than where we are now,” Naomi, real name Trinity, said. “We were a lot younger, way more immature. Life is different. Our careers have picked up. We got married. We’re home owners now. I’m full-on, hands-on with my step kids now, which I love. We’re truly adulting.”

The “Feel the Glow” personality has gotten used to the cameras, even when she butts heads with her fellow WWE spouse. In recent episodes of Season 8, Naomi is missing family in Atlanta and wants to spend time with Jon outside of Pensacola. This leads to some uneasy marital discussions.

“Everything that comes with our lifestyle now is not going to be perfect and easy all the time,” she said. “We’re trying to understand each other’s wants and needs at this point in our life because we have both changed as people. That’s what I’m learning and what we are trying to figure out in our marriage right now.

“You’re getting to see that unfold on Total Divas. It’s real, what is going on and where we are. Hopefully, it can help out other couples and others who are watching can relate because they are going through similar situations.

“What we put out is real, and what we put out is with no regrets. It’s very important to see that as much as we love each other, there are flaws. It’s a constant fight to get through life.

"All About Meghan Markle's Daring Pair of Go-to Earrings, Loved by Kendall Jenner & More
Meghan Markle loves her daring gold talon hook earrings from the luxury British jeweler Shaun Leane — and she’s in fashionable company: models Cara Delevingne, Kendall Jenner and Anja Rubik are also fans.

“I’m very flattered that Meghan wears our work,” Leane tells PEOPLE from his atelier and showroom in London’s Mayfair.

Leane says Meghan, who has made his earrings one of her go-to jewelry pieces in recent months, “is the woman I have in my mind when I design.”

“She dresses very elegantly, very chic, with very clean lines but with a really nice strong silhouette,” he adds. “It’s very confidant.”

The royal, who is expecting her first child with Prince Harry, owns three pieces from the avant-garde jeweler: the Yellow Gold Vermeil Diamond Tusk Bangle ($1281), Yellow Gold Vermeil Serpents Trace Slim Bracelet ($708) and the popular Yellow Gold Vermeil Talon Earrings ($290), all of which were purchased as a gift by Meghan’s close friend Markus Anderson.

Meghan first wore the pieces to the Queen’s 92nd birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall on April, just days after Anderson purchased them.

She has since worn them on multiple other occasions — to Charlie van Straubenzee’s wedding in August, at a performance of Hamilton, also in August, and most recently on her royal tour Down Under with Harry.

The earrings — which also come in silver, rose gold vermeil and silver black rhodium — are one of Leane’s signatures, inspired by the jeweler’s 20-year working relationship with the late British fashion designer Alexander McQueen and their shared love of tribal jewelry.

“The earrings are quite intriguing when they are worn. They make you want to look twice, and I love that reaction,” says Leane.

“They are elegant and refined,” he explains, “but there’s an edge.”

"Russell Simmons’ Accuser Tells Megyn Kelly ‘He Actually Apologized’
UPDATE, with video Former model Keri Claussen Khalighi told Megyn Kelly this morning that music mogul Russell Simmons has privately apologized to her for sexually assaulting her, despite his public insistence that what happened in 1991, when she was 17 years old, was consensual.

“Russell and I have actually had a face-to-face confrontation about what happened, we’ve had phone conversations where there was no dispute about what we were taking about,” Khalighi told Kelly during a live interview from her home in Los Angeles with the NBC morning show host. “And he actually apologized,” Khalighi added.

‘What he’s speaking about privately with me is completely different from what’s come out publicly,’ Khalighi says.

“Part of what’s so confusing and re-traumatizing is that what he’s speaking about privately with me is completely different from what’s come out publicly,” Khalighi continued.”That’s the piece that’s been, quite honestly, repugnant with hypocirsy and the lies and the denial.”

Khalighi, who is about to deliver her third child, recalled 1991 incident in detail. Simmons and Ratner, she said, after meeting her, invited her to Simmons’ apartment on the pretext of seeing a music video they had produced. As the video played, she said, Simmons began sexually assaulting her, ripping off her clothes, Kelly reported, forcing her to perform oral sex and later intercourse, all in Ratner’s presence.

“I looked over at Brett and asked for help, because I thought he was a friend,” Khalighi told Kelly, before realizing that “this was their plan all along. There was no help that was gonna come.” Khalighi said that “in the fashion circles it was widely known that they had a reputation for being modelizers…”

Of course, many aficionados insist that Kevin Conroy, the vocal-talent star of several animated TV series and made-for-video films, is the all-time best Batman. Others will weigh in with recommendations for another heard-but-not-seen star, Will Arnett of “The Lego Batman Movie.” And Troy Baker certainly has a loyal following as the Batvoice for a batch of video games.

But we have opted to limit this list of least-to-best actors (not movies, mind you, but actors) who have donned the cape and cowl in live-action feature films or movie serials. (Yes, Virginia: Even Adam West got a big-screen showcase back in the day.) OK: Let the Batranking begin.","0"
"Dana Scully
Fictional character in the television series The X-Files

Fictional character

Dana Katherine Scully, M.D., is a fictional character and one of the two protagonists in the Fox science-fiction, supernatural television series The X-Files, played by Gillian Anderson. Scully is a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent and a medical doctor (MD), partnered with fellow Special Agent Fox Mulder for seasons one to seven and seasons 10 and 11, and with John Doggett in the eighth and ninth seasons. In the television series, they work out of a cramped basement office at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC to investigate unsolved cases labeled ""X-Files."" In 2002, Scully leaves government employment, and in 2008, she begins working as a surgeon in a private Catholic hospital, where she stays for seven years, until rejoining the FBI. In contrast to Mulder's credulous ""believer"" character, Scully is the skeptic for the first seven seasons, choosing to base her beliefs on what science can prove. She later on becomes a ""believer"" after Mulder's abduction at the end of season seven.

Scully has appeared in all but five episodes of The X-Files, and in the 20th Century Fox films The X-Files, released in 1998, and The X-Files: I Want to Believe, released 10 years later. The episodes in which she does not appear are ""3,"" ""Zero Sum,"" ""Unusual Suspects,"" ""Travelers"" and ""The Gift"" (excluding archive footage). The eleventh season marked Anderson's final time portraying the character.[2]

Background [ edit ]

Dr. Dana Katherine Scully was born on February 23, 1964, in Annapolis, Maryland, to William (Don S. Davis) and Margaret Scully (Sheila Larken), into a close-knit Catholic family with Irish ancestry.[3][4] She has an older brother, Bill Jr., an older sister, Melissa, and a younger brother, Charles, who is never seen on the show except in flashbacks.[5] In the canonical 2016 comic book series, published by IDW Publishing, the two-part issue ""Ishmael"" revealed Scully","0"
"Ricky Martin Engaged to Jwan Yosef
Wedding bells are ringing for Ricky Martin!

The 44-year-old singer breaks the news to Ellen DeGeneres in a Wednesday appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, revealing that he popped the question to artist Jwan Yosef — his boyfriend of more than a year.

“We just got engaged,” he gushed. “I proposed. I was really nervous. But I got on my knees and I took out —not a box— I just had them in a little velvet pouch.”

Martin had a slightly different way of popping the traditional question. “Instead of saying, ‘Will you marry me?’ I said, ‘I got you something.’ I said, ‘I want to spend my life with you.’ And he was like, ‘What is the question?’ [I said] ‘Would you marry me?'”

Leo Marinho/Splash News

He adds: “It was very beautiful … He said yes.”

The pair made their red carpet debut in April at the amFAR Inspiration Gala in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Martin seemed to confirm the relationship by posting an Instagram photo of the pair at the event with the caption, “Yup.”

Martin flashes his engagement band on the show, and tells DeGeneres that the two are now living together.

“He’s a conceptual artist, and I’m a collector. So I started looking for art and I saw his art and I went crazy because I love what he does, really original, and I contacted him — and then I collected him,” Martin says with a laugh.

Martin, who is the father of 8-year-old twin sons Valentino and Matteo, split from Carlos Gonzalez Abella in 2014.","0"
"5 Things to Know About Kate McKinnon's Girlfriend Jackie Abbott
When you're a celebrity, throwing caution to the wind and posting every second of your life à la Kardashian is a valid life choice, but some look at that approach and turn 180 degrees the opposite way. Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon is one of those people.

The Emmy winner is famously private, giving few details about her personal life and even fewer about her romantic life. We know she's not one to talk about dating, we know she's gay, and we know she told GQ in a cover story that she's the antithesis of an over-sharer.

""I get criticized by people who know me the best for not sharing enough details about my day or my life. I am just quite an insular person, I guess,"" she said.

""I just… I decided in my mid-20s that I didn't feel comfortable sharing personal details like I had in the previous few years. And I just have run with that ever since.""

For all intents and purposes, she's continuing to run that way now, though we do know a little bit more than before. As of last year, she was dating an actress named Jackie Abbott. Here's what you should know about McKinnon's girlfriend ahead of the 2018 Emmys, where we've got our fingers crossed for a red carpet couple debut.

Bruce Glikas

1. McKinnon and Abbott stepped out as a couple at the 2017 Emmys.

But not on the red carpet (dang). Abbott sat next to McKinnon in the audience, and when the SNL star won the award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, she and Abbott embraced.

It was the most primetime camera moment the two shared all night.

2. Like McKinnon, Abbott is a performer.

She's an actor living in New York City with an IMDb page all to herself, so clearly, she and McKinnon have a lot in common. Past credits of hers include ""Murder, My Tweet"" and ""Miss Sugar Tit,"" which were both short films.

3. We only know McKinnon and Abbott definitely dating because of Michelle Visage from RuPaul's Drag Race.

"‘Teen Mom’ Briana DeJesus Undergoes ‘Mommy Makeover’
Teen Mom 2 star Briana DeJesus is recovering after another round of plastic surgery from the help of Dr. Michael “Dr. Miami” Salzhauer.

The 23-year-old shared a photo with Salzhauer on Instagram. “Can’t wait to see the final results in a few weeks,” she wrote in the caption, adding the hashtag, “New Body Who Dis.” She also tagged Salzhauer.

Videos by PopCulture.com

E! News reports that DeJesus also posted more photos of herself after the procedure on Instagram Stories. “Ew [laugh out loud] can’t wait for all the blood to wash off and dead skin to fall,” she wrote on one of the pictures.

“I did a tummy tuck, a breast lift with an implant exchange because she did have implants from before — she wanted to be smaller, higher and perkier — so we changed her implants out for smaller ones,” Salzhauer told E! News. “And we also did some contouring and reshaping of her booty, of her shape overall. We did that, I think it was a week ago Monday.”

Salzhauer said DeJesus “did great,” especially since she went to him before.

“I am happy that she’s sharing her journey with the world because there are a lot of moms that want mommy makeovers and they’re scared,” Salzhauer told E! News. “Seeing somebody that they know, even if it’s through social media, go through it is helpful as far as educating people about it.”

As InTouch Weekly reported last week, DeJesus also shared graphic before and after photos on Snapchat. Javi Marroquin, who broke up with DeJesus last month, was by DeJesus’ side to support her. However, her decision to get plastic surgery was one of the reasons for the split.

“Javi and I are not together anymore. Our future just doesn’t line up. He doesn’t want me to get my surgery for a breast lift, lipo, and tummy tuck (which I’m doing in two weeks) because it’ll look bad on his name at work. Also, I don’t plan on moving in with him in the summer and for these reasons, he broke up with me,” she told Blasting Ne","0"
"Wells Adams Says Living With Girlfriend Sarah Hyland Has Been 'Weirdly Perfect' (Exclusive)
There's no stopping the love between Wells Adams and Sarah Hyland.

If you ask the 34-year-old Bachelor In Paradise bartender and radio personality how he feels about his relationship with the 27-year-old Modern Family star, it's clear how head-over-heels he truly is, and appreciates his luck immensely.

Adams -- who appeared on season 12 of The Bachelorette and then Bachelor in Paradise -- dropped by to chat with ET's Lauren Zima on Roses and Rose Live on Tuesday, where he opened up about how things are going with his lady love.

""I’m just so happy,"" Wells said. ""I did these crazy shows and then all of a sudden I get this amazing relationship out of it. I could’ve never imagined that was the path I was going to go down, but I’m so grateful for all of it.""

Hyland, a self-professed Bachelor Nation superfan, connected with Wells over Instagram last year after seeing him on the show, and the two hit it off spectacularly.

In fact, Adams revealed that Bachelor host Chris Harrison even takes a bit of credit for his happy relationship.

""One thing you [didn’t see on this season of Bachelor in Paradise], was when I walked down the stairs and Chris Harrison was like, 'You’re welcome for your girlfriend!' And it’s so true!"" Adams recalled. ""If I hadn’t done the show and met Chris and all those people, I would have never had the opportunity to meet this amazing woman. So, I won the show!""

Adams finally moved to Los Angeles from his hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, a month ago when he began living together with Hyland, and he says their life under the same roof has pretty harmonious.

""It's been weirdly perfect, there have been no real issues. We were scared about the dogs meeting, but that went really well. It’s been perfect. It’s been great,"" Adams shared.

With the couple approaching the 1-year anniversary of the day they met, Adams reflected on what that moment meant for him and ","0"

"Ellen pranks Matt Lauer with scary Savannah Guthrie double
Matt Lauer jumped out of his seat during an interview on Thursday.

The Today Show host was shocked to see a Savannah Guthrie impersonator in a floral dress come out of nowhere to scare him when on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show.

'It's so petty. It’s so childish!' laughed Matt after taking a second to find his composure. 'Now I wet my suit. It’s the only suit I have.'

Scroll down for video

Happy to see me? Matt Lauer stopped by Ellen DeGeneres' show this week, where he got a huge surprise in the form of a prank from the hostess

Matt was talking to Ellen about music when the man came from out of nowhere causing the 59-year-old to jump in horror.

'Oh, God!' squealed the Ohio University alum.

Making the scary surprise even sillier, the prankster was clad in a caramel blonde wig and floral dress to look like Matt's co-host Guthrie - although the resemblance was hard to find.

Fun packed visit: At the studio, Ellen scared the AM anchor by having a staffer dress like his Today Show co-host Savannah Guthrie and jump out in the middle of their interview

Outta here! The New York native immediately jumped from his seat, much to the delight of the comedienne

Ellen was pleased with her prank.

She laughed and smiled, clearly happy she got the best of Lauer.

'That was one of my favorites,' said DeGeneres, hardly able to contain her laughter. 'That was my favorite [prank] so far.'

'It's so childish': Although the prank clearly surprised him, Matt and Ellen have a history of playing elaborate jokes on each other

Not quite twinning: Although it was a nice dress, it was hard to see the resemblance between them and Savannah

Instant replay! The blonde hostess made sure that the audience - and Matt - got to see the prank again

"Colbert Found a Secret Weapon to Irk Trump at the Emmys: Sean Spicer
X content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Was there ever any doubt that Stephen Colbert would use his platform at the Emmys to knock Donald Trump? The comedian has mercilessly jabbed at the president since the campaign trail, honing his voice as David Letterman’s replacement on The Late Show with Trump as his perennial punching bag. (He even got him to respond once.) So on Sunday night, as he approached the lectern to kick off the 2017 Emmy Awards gala, Colbert naturally used his platform to rip the president. There was one surprise, however: a guest appearance by Sean Spicer.

For his opening act, Colbert did a song-and-dance number running through various shows up for Emmys this year, including This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Handmaid’s Tale. The chorus? “Everything is better on TV”—including, in a slightly more veiled jab at Trump, “treason.” Once he finally took the stage—along with a chorus of dancing Handmaids—Colbert thanked first responders for their work following hurricanes in Texas and Florida. After that, however, he didn’t take long to get to the Trump jokes: “If he had won an Emmy,” Colbert quipped, “I bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You liked Walter White; he’s just Walter, much whiter.”

“Unlike the presidency,” Colbert added, “Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.”

Still, Colbert couldn’t leave the stage without finding some special way to hit the president where it really hurts. So he brought out his secret weapon: Sean Spicer.

Although he stayed mostly on message during his recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live and avoided dinging the president, Spicer did appear on stage Sunday night behind a lectern to comment on the TV Academy gala’s crowd size: “This is the biggest audience to witness an Emmys, period,” Spicer said with a straig","0"
"The Mad Pooper Is Sorry For Repeatedly Pooping on Colorado Family's Lawn
The man claiming to represent The Mad Pooper uploaded another video to YouTube, explaining that he isn’t the woman’s “spokesperson,” and his original video was created in order to deceive people.

The ""Mad Pooper,"" a jogger who gained viral fame earlier this month after allegedly defecating on a Colorado family's front lawn for weeks, has finally broken her public silence not with a fart, but with an apology through an anonymous spokesperson.

In a video uploaded to YouTube this week that's since been removed, a man claiming to be a ""family representative"" called the woman ""Shirley,"" and says she's sorry for her actions, but suffers from a traumatic brain injury that's forced her to lose control of her bowels. Oddly, the man stated that the woman's penchant for dropping turds in public is a right protected under the United States Constitution, although the nation's founding document guarantees no such bathroom privileges in explicit terms.

Local outlet KRDO interviewed Colorado Springs criminal defense attorney, Jeremy Lowe, about constitutionally protected public pooping. “Defecating in someone’s yard is definitely not protected under the First Amendment and it is actually a crime,” the lawyer stated.

Earlier this month, the Mad Pooper conjured a viral sh*t-storm after using the Budde family's front yard as a public toilet during her neighborhood jogs. The intrigue surrounding the Mad Pooper, who seemed remorseless as she left a trail of smelly terror in her wake, spawned something of a media frenzy. As a prize for her vile escapades, Charmin offered her a lifetime supply of free toilet paper -- which only seemed to further incentivize the act of pooping in public:","0"
"Pregnant Claire Danes Says Filming ‘Homeland’ During First Trimester Was 'Embarrassing'
Claire Danes may have put her pregnancy out in the open on Wednesday, but while she was filming the most recent season of Homeland, she had to keep quiet.

“I’m knocked up!” she jokingly announced on Wednesday’s Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

The 39-year-old actress revealed she was in her first trimester of pregnancy while filming her hit drama, calling the time her “least favorite phase.”

“You just feel horrible. You just feel rotten and you’re not allowed to say why,” she explained to host Fallon. “I was filming quite a lot and just inadvertently falling asleep all the time. It was just embarrassing.”

Revealing she “face planted” onto a crocheted bag in between takes, Danes noted that she had a rude awakening when it was time for her close up.

“I have this crocheted indentation all on the side of my face. It looked like I had third degree burns,” she said of the marks. “They were massaging my face. They had to get out the blow dryer. I halted production for a good half an hour. I felt like an idiot.”

These days, she’s in the “cruisy second trimester.”

“It gets a little excited when I have a chocolate bar. It’s moving and kicking,” she said of her second child. “I love that part. It’s like a fireworks show every so often. It’s really cool and a little creepy. It is, it’s like an alien being in there, cohabitating, yeah, AirBNB.”

Danes announced her second pregnancy during Howard Stern’s SiriusXM show on Wednesday after being asked about the love scenes on Homeland, which airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Showtime.

The actress and her husband, Hugh Dancy, are already parents to 5-year-old son Cyrus.

"Pete Davidson: Biography, Comedian, Actor
1993-present

Who Is Pete Davidson?

Comedian and actor Pete Davidson has found a sympathetic fan base by transforming his own personal issues and tragedies into wince-worthy, hilarious confessions on stage. After starting his stand-up comedy career and appearing on a handful of television shows, 20-year-old Davidson became one of the youngest cast members of the sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live in 2014 and remained there for seven seasons. He has hosted several comedy specials and appeared in several films, including The King of Staten Island, which is loosely based on his life. He has also made headlines for his love life, particularly for his brief engagement to pop singer Ariana Grande, and his relationship with Kim Kardashian, which drew the ire of her ex-husband Kanye West.

Quick Facts

FULL NAME: Peter Michael Davidson

BORN: November 16, 1993

BIRTH CITY: Staten Island, New York

ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Scorpio

Early Life and Career

Getty Images Pete Davidson with his mother, Amy, in May 2021

Pete Davidson was born Peter Michael Davidson on November 16, 1993, in Staten Island, New York, to parents Amy and Scott Davidson. His father was a firefighter with Ladder 118 in Brooklyn who died while responding to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Scott’s death deeply traumatized Pete, who had problems in school and at one point ripped out all his hair until he was bald.

A group of psychologists monitored Davidson for several years to study the psychological effects in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks; Davidson described himself as a “lab rat” in these experiments. He had suicidal thoughts as a child and attempted suicide at age 9. Davidson credits the rapper Kid Cudi—who’s used his music to share his own battle with suicide—for having saved his life. “I would’ve killed myself if I didn’t have Kid Cudi,” he told the morning radio show The Breakfast Club. “I truly believe if Man on the Moon didn’t come out,","0"
"D.A. Believes Nicole Eggert, But Scott Baio Won't be Prosecuted for Sexual Assault
Scott Baio will not be prosecuted for allegedly sexually assaulting Nicole Eggert during the run of ""Charles in Charge,"" but we've learned the D.A. found her credible.

Sources familiar with the case tell us on Wednesday Nicole met the L.A. County Deputy D.A., who is reviewing the case. Our sources say the D.A. found Nicole's allegations ""credible."" As we reported, Eggert claimed Baio repeatedly molested her between ages 14 and 18. Baio insists they had sex only once ... when she was 18.

Our sources say the D.A. called the case ""potentially prosecutable"" ... were it not for the statute of limitations.

Under current law there's no statute of limitations if an adult sexually assaults a minor. But, when the alleged assaults occurred in the '80s, the statute of limitations was 3 years, which means it has long since run out.

There's an argument that old cases could still be prosecuted if the statute hadn't run when the law changed, but in this case the statute ran before the law changed, so case closed.

Eggert tells TMZ, ""I always knew this case was beyond statutes of limitations and unfortunately the DA would not be able to prosecute Scott Baio. However I also knew the importance of laying the groundwork for any future victims of Baio's that may come forward and to warn parents who might unknowingly allow their children to be alone with this molester.""

She goes on ... ""I could no longer keep up the lie he conditioned me into and felt it a Mother's responsibility to put the truth out there.""","0"

"Shannon Beador Gives Update on Divorce, David Beador
Shannon Beador is starting off this season of The Real Housewives of Orange County in the midst of one of the hardest things anyone would ever have to go through: divorce.

The last time we saw Shannon at the Season 12 RHOC reunion, she had announced that she and her husband, David Beador, had separated after 17 years of marriage. This season of RHOC kicks off as Shannon is in the midst of divorce proceedings with David. She officially filed for divorce from David on December 1, 2017.

Even though Shannon is still going through the process of divorce today, she said she is in a much better place than when we last saw her during that emotionally raw reunion. ""Life today at this very moment couldn't be better. I am honestly happy. And it's not me trying to convince anybody that I'm happy. I'm happy,"" she told The Daily Dish during an interview in New York City Monday. ""I pinch myself sometimes. I'm so grateful and blessed for the things that are going on in my life and for the people that I have in my life right now. So things are very good.""

It took Shannon some time and a lot of soul searching to get to this positive place. ""After the reunion when we officially announced the separation, it was difficult for me because even though we had been separated for a little over a month, it had become public, and now everybody knew about it. It just made it real to me,"" she said. ""So there was a long period of sadness and a lot of tears and a lot of pain. And I had to process through that pain. And I think that I emerged from it by literally staying home and learning to be happy with myself, that I came out a stronger person. And I know that whether I found another partner or not, I'm gonna be OK standing on my own. It's all a blessing.""

"Chrissy Metz Thinks Her Emmy Nomination Is “the Best Welcome-Back Gift Ever”
When asked how she feels about her Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, Chrissy Metz responds pretty much how one would expect: “It hasn’t really sunken in,” she says.

“I’m so excited about the show being recognized, and all of the actors in other categories from the show,” Metz continued. “So I’m like, ‘Oh, right!’ It hasn’t sunken in, but it’s just overwhelmingly amazing to be recognized by your peers—especially when I revere so many of them.”

The best part? Thursday is her first day back on set as This Is Us Season 2 begins filming. “Isn’t that amazing?“ Metz says, audibly ecstatic. “This is the best welcome-back gift ever!”

As for what’s coming up in the NBC smash, the actress promises that fans will soon find out what, exactly, happened to Jack. (Milo Ventimiglia received his first Emmy nomination—for Lead Actor—on Thursday for the role.) Metz’s character, Kate, expressed guilt last season about her father’s death; apparently, she feels as though it’s her fault somehow. The cast has known the backstory for a while, Metz said, and soon, fans will, too.

“I don’t want to give away anything or potentially give away anything, but we’re going to find out really, really soon into the season about how it all unfortunately went down and the guilt that Kate has on her conscience, and why, and all of that,” Metz promised.

As for whether she or any of the cast feel pressure going into the second season of such a buzzy, beloved show, the actress said she tries to take things in stride and stay authentic—and, perhaps more importantly, vulnerable. That openness is, after all, what made her character—and perhaps the whole show—so popular with viewers in the first place. As Metz sees it, “We all have these ideas in our heads about what people think about us, which are so not true. And so we are always combatting what people think about us, and how we should make ot","0"
"Paris Hilton Is Keeping Her $2 Million Engagement Ring: ‘Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend’
Paris Hilton has decided on the fate of her 20-carat engagement ring.

After calling it quits from ex-fiancé Chris Zylka, the reality star has revealed that she is keeping the ring even though their relationship didn’t work out.

Makes sense why she isn’t parting with a $2.2 million ring, men come and go but diamonds are forever!

The ring came with a lot of publicity

Since her engagement to actor and model, Chris Zylka, Paris Hilton has been showing off her pear-shaped diamond ring for all to see.

When the pair decided to call it quits after being engaged for ten-months, Hilton decided to keep the ring to herself.

She recently revealed to SiriusXM‘s Jenny McCarthy that the ring gave jeweler, Michael Greene, a ton of publicity since announcing her engagement to Zylka.

“The person who we got it from got millions and millions of dollars of free publicity,” Hilton said. “I love how social media has basically become a new form of money. Yeah, it’s pretty sick.”

Let’s be real, a ring that size and worth that much money would obviously get a ton of publicity.

Paris Hilton is taking a break from wearing the ring

Since news of her split from Chris Zylka, Hilton has opted out of wearing the ring for some time.

One week after the split, the heiress was spotted in Australia posing with her wedding finger bare. After flashing the rock for ten-months, Hilton is giving her wedding finger a break since we’re pretty sure 20-carat rings are a little bit on the heavy side (I personally wouldn’t know).

Hilton called off her engagement

News of Paris Hilton and Chris Zylka’s split broke headlines back in November.

After posting the news of their breakup on Instagram, Hilton appeared on the daytime talk show, The Talk, and discussed the reasoning behind ending her relationship with Zylka by stating, “When I fall in love, I fall in love fast and hard, and it was this whirlwind romance,” ","0"
"French Open: Serena Williams pulls out with injury before Maria Sharapova match
Serena Williams pulled out of the French Open before her fourth-round match with Maria Sharapova because of an injury that affected her serve.

The 23-time Grand Slam winner recently returned to tennis after giving birth to her first child, but looked in good form in her opening matches.

""I've had issues with the right pectoral muscle to the point where I can't serve,"" said the 36-year-old.

""I'll have a scan. I won't know about Wimbledon until I get the results.""

Williams said she first felt the problem during her third-round win over German 11th seed Julia Gorges on Saturday.

She played in a doubles match with sister Venus on Sunday, saying she wanted to try to manage the problem before her match with Sharapova.

""I tried lots of taping and support to see how it felt in match circumstances,"" Williams said.

""It is hard to play when I can't physically serve. I've never had this injury before, I've never felt it in my life and it was so painful.

""I don't know how to manage it.""

Williams said she will have an MRI scan in Paris on Tuesday and will stay in the French capital at least until the extent of her injury is clear.

Sharapova said she was ""looking forward"" to playing Williams and ""disappointed"" the American had to withdraw.

""I wish her a speedy recovery and hope she returns to the tour soon,"" she added.

The 31-year-old Russian, a two-time winner at Roland Garros, will play 2016 champion Garbine Muguruza. The Spaniard was 2-0 up in the opening set of her match against Lesia Tsurenko when the Ukrainian retired hurt.","0"
"Watch a Closet Be Completely Transformed Into a Glamorous Office Space
Every product on this page was chosen by a Harper's BAZAAR editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.

In the second episode of Design Girlfriend, Alia Ahmed-Yahia and Jamie Bosworth are back for another home décor transformation. This time, they are taking on their upstairs closet in hopes of turning it into a fashionable office space. With a sleek desk, eye-catching wallpaper, DIY shelves, and a striking chandelier, a space of miscellaneous fashion finds revamps into a modern office nook.

After removing the doors and shelves form the closet, Alia and Jamie start with choosing Calico wallpaper as the feature focus of the space. ""The wallpaper is like a handbag in fashion,"" Alia says, ""where your eye is automatically drawn the second you walk into a room. The wallpaper looks like artwork in itself, and acts as the one dramatic element.""

She takes this wallpaper scene one step further with a clever design idea: creating your own ""live mood board."" By taking the same wallpaper she used for the office space in a larger scale, and placing it on clipboards, the clipboards then become apart of the wall, and a place for you to put whatever is inspiring you in the moment.

For a second creative design idea, Alia makes a book spine basket, with the end product looking just like a shelf of books. By affixing cardboard to a HomeGoods basket, and fashioning on top of that with fabric glue, the innovative storage space comes to life. ""When I think about creating design solutions, I really want them to look elevated,"" she says. ""If it looks like a hack, it is a hack. If someone sees this and is surprised by it, then I did my job.""

When it comes to lighting, Alia thinks that bigger is better. ""Having a really great, oversized chandelier makes a small space feel bigger. A lot of people think you have to match the scale of the room to the fixtures, but I love a bang fixture. It's so","0"
"Jennifer Aydin: ""It's All in the Kiss""
Hello, fellow Bravoholic’s!

How to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New Jersey on Peacock and Bravo.

I’m Jennifer and so happy to be here! My journey with these women finally begins and it’s been quite a roller coaster.

Is There a Rocky Road Ahead For Melissa and Teresa?

I have to say first and foremost, after seeing everything Teresa and Melissa have been through, it’s amazing to see how far they have come! Family dynamics can be complicated and there’s no one method to the madness. Because each family is unique, you have to figure out what works for you- and sometimes there’s a lot of trial and error that’s involved and that’s OK! I can totally relate to Teresa. Sometimes, when you know your parents are feeling low, you expect your siblings to help and contribute, to help bring them back up, to make them feel important and special. A little bit of love goes a long way, so let’s keep the love flowing people!

Teresa is so disciplined over this fitness competition. I know she says it’s a huge stress reliever for her, but for me, just the thought of working out is a stress creator - I sweat just thinking about it! Wait, can that count as a workout? Lol! I love the idea of a fitness competition but it stops there. I’m not that ambitious! I don’t think I would even have the discipline. I just don’t want it bad enough. Plus Bill will hate me on stage in a bikini. Come to think of it, so would I!

And I love the fact that Marge is such a fierce business woman! I would love to have my own business or even businesses in the future! Hey, it’s good to set goals! And I love her idea about the pajamas and I see her point that she works from home and wants to stay in her comfy jammies, but isn’t it ironic that she sleeps naked?! #TMI! But all kidding aside, I’d love a new pair of pajamas! hint, hint ;)

I love Dolores and Frank’s relationship! They are amazing roles models of how divorced couples should behave! And could it be that’s","0"
"4 Times Prince Harry Made Us Swoon at the (Well, His) Royal Wedding
Following the ceremony, the couple pulled away from the church in a gorgeous horse-drawn carriage. Meghan let out a simple ""Wow"" at her first site of the crowds. Harry, however, was little bit more cheeky: According to the Telegraph, who consulted with lip reader Tina Lannin, he said to his bride: ""I'm ready for a drink now."" That seems more than reasonable.

His reception toast:

During the couple's first reception, a luncheon event hosted by the Queen, Harry reportedly grabbed the mic for an impromptu toast. According to a guest who attended the event and spoke to People, Harry delighted guests by calling Meghan ""my wife"" for the very first time.

“It was very off-the-cuff, which was lovely,” the guest revealed. “He promised that all the Americans wouldn’t steal the swords and said, ‘Please, when you leave, be quiet as you don’t want to wake the neighbors,’ which was quite fun.”

As the guest also noted, the event was “more than you would ever imagine it to be. It did feel like we were really part of their very special occasion. It just felt about the two of them, which was great.”

"American Horror Story: Cult Recap: Send in the Clowns
American Horror Story: Cult is not helping. Most people living in Trump’s America want one of two things, based on which side of the political divide they fall. Liberals want the scripted equivalent of a big hug, coupled with an announcement that Trump will be called out for his ties to Russia and quickly impeached. Meanwhile, Trump’s fervent base wants the sort of legitimacy that says not only are they important, but they are also right.

Neither of those groups will get what they want from AHS: Cult, at least not judging by the first episode. As “Election Night” begins, we meet avatars for the left and the right in a small town in Michigan, a battleground state that went uncharacteristically red in 2016. In the blue corner is Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson), a liberal lesbian who feels like her very way of life has been attacked and that her family will be ripped apart by the Trump administration. In the red corner is Kai Anderson (Evan Peters), a blue-haired do-nothing who seems to live in his parents’ basement, and who wants to use the chaos of Trump’s presidency to cull the weak from the herd.

What’ll be uncomfortable for viewers is that neither of these characters are right. Ally is just ridiculous, letting politics ruin a very nice life with her wife, Ivy (Alison Pill), and her young son, Ozzy. Even worse, she is someone who committed an unspeakable act against her community: She voted for Jill Stein. The big reveal of Ally’s vote is straight-up camp and played brilliantly. We realize that the reason why Ally is so tortured by the outcome is because she cast a protest vote, one of just 11,000 that could have swayed Michigan to Clinton. Like in so many horror movies, she is tortured by her betrayal, but this one seems both monumental and insignificant at the same time.

Paulson is playing an unhinged woman perfectly, and Ally surely has more than her fair share of problems. Just like the rest of Amer","0"

The recent allegations of Hollywood star Morgan Freeman sexually harassing women has shocked many of his fans. Now, American TV host and writer Janet Mock has revealed that just a few years ago when she interviewed Freeman, she too had an unpleasant experience. In a new interview , she described him as 'the creepy uncle at the barbecue'.Janet, who was at the time working as an on-air reporter, sat down with the veteran actor to discuss his film '5 Flights Up' (2014).In a newly published clip of their interview, you can see him asking her, ""How you all manage to do that all the time?"" When she asked him if he was talking about hair and make-up, he responds, ""No, you got a dress that's halfway between your knee and your hips and you sit down right across from me and you cross your legs.""According to Janet, Freeman knew the camera was rolling. She told a reporter later that this shows how men in power believe that they have free rein to do whatever they want. She believes that as a young woman who was just trying to do a job as a reporter, she just wanted to interview him for the movie and so, for him to turn into the 'creepy uncle at the barbecue' was strange.","0"

Meet Kulture Kiari!

On Wednesday, proud mama Cardi B shared the first photo of her 4-month-old daughter with now-estranged husband Offset.

“My heart,” Cardi, 26, captioned the Instagram, which shows baby Kulture looking away from the camera while sitting in a car seat, wearing a bib with her name written across it.

The big reveal comes just hours after Cardi announced her split from Offset, 26, after a year of marriage.

“So everybody been bugging me and everything and you know I’ve been trying to work things out with my baby’s father for a hot minute now,” Cardi said in a since-deleted video shared on Instagram.

“We are really good friends and we are really good business partners — you know he’s always somebody that I run to talk to, and we got a lot of love for each other — but things just haven’t been working out between us for a long time.”

“It’s nobody fault I guess we just grew out of love, but we are not together anymore. It might take time to get a divorce and I’m going to always have a lot of love for him because he is my daughter’s father,” Cardi concluded.

Offset responded to Cardi’s video writing, “Y’all won” in the comment section.

The former couple, who revealed they secretly tied the knot in September 2017, welcomed Kulture on July 10. Kulture is the fourth child for the Migos rapper, who has three children from previous relationships.

"Chris Pratt wrote the foreword to Anna Faris' new book before announcing separation
Chris Pratt wrote the foreword to Anna Faris' upcoming memoir Unqualified before announcing their separation.

The book is slated for an October release and delves into Anna, 40, and Chris' impromptu marriage in Bali, the birth of their son Jack, 4, and how they managed to get through a tumultuous time of Hollywood gossip.

And Chris, 38, writes fondly of his wife of eight years.

""She is fierce and very loyal, she rarely punishes people. But when she does, it’s powerful and terrifying, and when it’s over, it’s really over. (Power and terror are acceptable in a partner but absolutely necessary in a mother, as far as I’m concerned),"" The opening pages, obtained by Entertainment Weekly, read. ""And she does mother very well, both our son, Jack, and me, when needed.""

Part of the memoir discusses Hollywood gossip and jealousy.

Anna reveals that she feels jealousy when Chris has an on-screen kiss with an another actress, though she has learned to befriend them instead of stirring a dramatic situation. She says it's in a genuine way and not in a ""frenemy"" way.

Similarly, Chris felt jealous when Anna filmed scenes with Chris Evans in the 2011 film What's Your Number?, though they later became friends and Marvel colleagues.

According to Entertainment Weekly, an entire chapter of Unqualified details every sweet thing Chris does for Anna, including, ""braiding her hair, writing poems and letters by hand from international locations, sending flowers to the set of Mom every Friday before the show tapes, and giving her thoughtful, and unexpected gifts.""

"Bella Hadid gushes over beau The Weeknd and admits 'gaining respect' from fellow models is 'hard'
Bella Hadid loves horses, butterflies and, most of all, her boyfriend.

The 22-year-old model gave a candid interview about her 'happy' life in a video for Vogue's 73 Questions series which was published Wednesday.

A horse stable served as the setting for the shoot as the beauty is an 'Olympic-class equestrian, who competed for 10 years.'

Candid chat: Bella Hadid gushed about boyfriend The Weeknd and her 'happy life' in a new episode of Vogue's 73 Questions which was published on Wednesday

The fast paced Q&A happened as the Victoria's Secret stunner walked through the stables happily feeding horses and snuggling a rescue goat named Olivia.

When asked who the most 'beautiful person' she knows is, the model didn't hesitate in saying 'my boyfriend.'

She also named her beau as the person who makes her 'laugh the hardest.'

Bella and R&B star The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) started dating in 2015 but broke up a year later. Over the summer in 2018 the couple reconciled and seem to be going strong.

Animal lover: The interview was done in horse stables as the practiced equestrian fed carrots to the horses and road off into the sunset

Stylish! The 22-year-old was decked out in impeccable riding gear

In love: Bella named her boyfriend The Weeknd as the person who makes her laugh the hardest and the 'most beautiful' person she knows

If from the outside it looks like the beautiful, globe trotting model-of-the-moment has an idyllic life, that's because she does and she's grateful for it.

Asked who she would want to 'switch' lives with, Hadid had no answer as she is currently 'really happy' in her life right now.

The interview jumped from topic to topic revealing things like the star liking the 'only thing' her mom Yolanda Hadid cooks: a bolognese.

"How Many Characters Does Neil Patrick Harris Play In 'A Series Of Unfortunate Events'? He Shows A Lot Of Range
A Series Of Unfortunate Events has a great many villains and enemies lurking within it, but none more menacing or inventive than Count Olaf. As terrible a man as he is an actor, Count Olaf spends Lemony Snicket's entire book series chasing after the Baudelaire orphans in the hopes of obtaining their massive fortune. In Netflix's adaptation, the menacing amateur thespian is portrayed by charming master thespian Neil Patrick Harris, but it sometimes looks like Count Olaf isn't the only role he'll play. Just how many characters is Neil Patrick Harris in A Series Of Unfortunate Events?

Technically, Harris is only playing the role of Count Olaf in the Series. However, Count Olaf himself portrays a number of characters, all in an effort to sneak his way closer to the Baudelaire orphans and get his hands on their immense wealth. The first season of A Series Of Unfortunate Events follows the orphans as they are sent to four different caregivers, during which they meet many different characters that Olaf portrays and usually catch his legion of henchman disguising themselves in various roles as well.

Harris uses the opportunity to play multiple roles to stellar effect, portraying the often ridiculous caricatures that Count Olaf thinks up. Here's a look at the many faces of Count Olaf in Season 1 of A Series Of Unfortunate Events. Beware, for there are minor A Series of Unfortunate Events spoilers for the book and TV show below.

Count Olaf

Introduced in The Bad Beginning of Snicket's horrid tale of the Baudelaire orphans, Count Olaf wastes no time establishing just how evil and cruel he is. He finds pleasure in other people's pain, lives in a dilapidated house with trash everywhere, and puts up elaborate song-and-dance numbers with his troupe of misfits.

"Tyra Banks Reveals Cellulite Has Always Been an 'Insecurity'
Tyra Banks continues to get candid about cosmetic surgery.

The supermodel – and co-author (with her mother) of a new memoir, Perfect Is Boring – recently revealed she had a nose job early in her career. “I feel I have a responsibility to tell the truth,” she said.

Now, she’s opening up again.

When asked if she would have more work done, Banks told E! News: “You know, I would, if there was something to remove cellulite I would totally do it…It doesn’t exist though.”

The 44-year-old explained that she “always had cellulite” and it continues to be an “insecurity.”

“When I walked down the Victoria’s Secret runway, I always covered my butt. Always,” she said. “People used to think, ‘Oh, she’s one of the top angels. That’s why she has a long train or extra.’ No, I was covering up my cellulite. Thank you Victoria’s Secret for working with me, they knew why I was doing it.”

Ultimately, Banks is hoping to encourage a more honest conversation about looks.

“Fix it or flaunt it — I think women should be able to do both,” she recently told PEOPLE. “There is a boundary line, either you’re super natural or you live at the plastic surgeon. It’s okay to hop back and forth over that line. You want a hair weave? Fine. You want permanent eyebrows? Fine. We as women need to stop judging.”","0"

A teenage mum contracted a stomach-churning case of gangrene after undergoing a potentially deadly tummy tuck and boob job.

‌



Krystle was left her scarred and infected after the botched procedure, which was supposed to get rid of her stretch marks and fix her tubular-shaped breasts.

‌



""I just wanted them to fix the problem and then, you know, they were already gonna be there, put implants in as well,"" Krystal - who signed up for the surgery after giving birth to her son at 15 - tells E!'s Botched, in one of its most shocking episodes yet.

‌



But things went dangerously wrong when doctors decided to fit her breast implants through the incision they'd made for the tummy tuck, leaving her massively susceptible to complications.

""Placing implants through a tummy tuck incision, in my opinion, it's never a good idea because it's a long way to go and the chance of a complication is really high,"" Dr Terry Dubrow told her.

‌



And when he learned that the surgery took a staggering 12 hours, he shockingly revealed she could actually have died right there on the operating table.

""Krystle's last surgery could have literally been her last surgery. Eight hours is the time when risks start to go up of anesthesia complications and difficulties from prolonged recovery,"" he explained.

“It’s been such an emotional couple of weeks,” says Kathy, tearing up. “I didn’t want it to be done, but I knew you had to go through what you had to and I’m just so proud of both of you — you and John.”

Of course, with the wedding back on, so is the stress that comes with planning.

“I feel like I’m still trying to process that John and I are back on and now I have to get back into wedding planning mode,” says Nikki. “And since we want to keep our same date, I am very behind. I feel like I have ideas in my head, but I think the only thing I actually have locked in right now is a place and an amazing wedding planning team.”

"Tennessee's Grant Williams wins March Madness' Preseason Player of the Year
The player of the year race is as wide open as the sport has recently seen.

Want to go with experience, a freshman, a player from a non-power league? You won’t be wrong — now. There are no poor answers within reason.

But we put forth our own 16-player bracket two weeks ago and asked fans to decide. The winner? Tennessee’s Grant Williams, who beat Indiana’s Juwan Morgan in the final vote.

In his sophomore campaign last season, Williams averaged 15.2 points, 6 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks, earning him SEC Player of the Year honors on a Tennessee team that went 26-9 overall and finished in first place in the conference with a 13-5 record.

Tennessee returns all five starters this season, and all six of its leading scorers, so Williams will have plenty of help as he tries to get Tennessee past the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2014.

Sixteen student-athletes qualified for our tournament of preseason player of the year candidates, seeded No. 1 through No. 16, in a four-round, single-elimination format. Voting was conducted on the @MarchMadness Twitter account and Instagram account beginning Monday, Oct. 15. The student-athlete with more fan votes in each matchup advanced to the next round.

Below are the results from each round of voting. Numbers at the end indicate vote percentage on Twitter:

Finals results:

(13) Grant Williams def. (15) Juwan Morgan (57-43)

Semifinals results:

(13) Grant Williams def. (1) Carsen Edwards (55-45)

(15) Juwan Morgan def. (3) Ethan Happ (52-48)

Second round results:

"Is Khloe Kardashian Pregnant Again? New Rumors She's Expecting Baby #2 With Tristan Thompson
Is Khloe Kardashian pregnant again? We all know that she has always wanted to be a mother. She’s talked about it candidly on Keeping up with the Kardashians, and has frequently expressed her desire to have a family of her own. After many years of trying, Khloe finally gave birth to her daughter, True, in April.

Around the time of True’s birth, Khloe’s boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, found himself at the center of a cheating scandal in which a video was released with him kissing and groping another woman. There were also salacious text messages he sent to his mistress. Would you really expect anything different from someone who cheated on his then-pregnant girlfriend to be with a Kardashian? Once a cheater, always a cheater?

A post shared by @krazyinlovewithkardashians on Aug 8, 2017 at 2:43pm PDT

It’s safe to assume Khloe wants more children in the future, but does that mean she’s been trying again with Tristan?

A source has said, “Khloe loved being pregnant, but she’s the first to say how great she feels now that she’s lost the baby weight. That being said, she could find herself pregnant again soon.”

Even so, the two recently took a trip to Mexico together, and according to the source, “they’ve been having tons of wild sex, especially on their trip to Mexico. It’s basically been like a mini honeymoon for them.”

The source also claims that Tristan wants more children as well and can be very persuasive. “He’s been saying that since they first fell in love he can see them having five or even six kids. That hasn’t changed; he loves being a dad and is even more in love with Khloe now that they have True. Khloe says she’s not ready to be pregnant again yet, but Tristan‘s a convincing guy,” the source revealed.

"Evangeline Lilly Blames ‘Misogynistic’ Stunt Coordinator for ‘Lost’ Set Injury
Evangeline Lilly recalled sustaining a pretty intense injury on the set of “Lost,” and blamed a bullying stunt coordinator for making her go through with it.

Speaking at a panel Wednesday night on Fox’s Los Angeles lot about women working in the stunt business, Lilly said that she expressed hesitation over a stunt she was asked to do without any protection on her forearms.

“There were open wounds, pus-y and oozing,” she said at the panel, according to Deadline, adding that the stunt coordinator was “misogynistic” and wouldn’t allow her to wear moleskin on her forearms as protection. She said that the liquid bandage New Skin was painfully applied after several of the takes. She said the stunt coordinator, who she did not name, told her the moleskin would be seen on camera.

“I looked like a mutant. My mom said, ‘You’ll never be able to wear an evening gown again!’” she said.

The stunt in question involved rolling off a tree branch and then hanging above the ground (she was harnessed to the branch to prevent falling), the actress recalled. Lilly said that she did the stunt multiple times, and each time more skin ripped from her forearms.

“I felt it was him saying, ‘I’m going to put you in your place for standing up to me,’” Lilly said of the stunt coordinator. “It was either cow to his power or hurt myself. I was in my twenties then. Now, I would probably back down.”

A rep for ABC, Lilly and studio Bad Robot did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment on the alleged incident.","0"

She also added that living with a writer is “very helpful” because “you can sort of whisper things in their ear as they’re falling asleep.”

"Chrissy Teigen Reveals She's Trying for a Second Child With Her Last Frozen Embryo
Chrissy Teigen has never been shy about her experiences with childbearing (despite the many trolls), letting other women who have gone through fertility issues and postpartum depression know that they're not alone. After trying for years to get pregnant and undergoing in vitro fertilization, Teigen and husband John Legend welcomed little Luna Simone into their family last year. And soon the Legend-Teigen clan might be getting slightly bigger, with Teigen revealing on Wednesday that the couple will be trying for another baby with her last remaining embyro.

In InStyle's November cover story, Teigen gets candid about the challenging journey she took to conceive Luna, who turned 1 in April, and, hopefully, baby No. 2. The model and Twitter laureate told the magazine that she wishes she had extracted more eggs during her fertility treatments from a few years ago, because the resulting 20 embryos were narrowed to just three healthy and usable ones.

""The first little girl didn't work, and then the second is Luna,” she said.

Teigen also elaborated on her experiences with postpartum depression and the decision to speak openly about her diagnosis. At first, InStyle reports, she didn't want to speak up because she didn't understand what she was going through and didn't think she had the right.

“I thought I was just being a selfish a-hole,” she told the publication. Things got better, Teigen says, after she was diagnosed and began taking the right medications. But the supermodel still has to battle through some days and said she's steeled herself for her condition getting more serious if she is going to have another baby.

“I have really good days and really bad days, and I don't tend to talk about the really bad days,” she said. “But I would hate for people to think those days didn’t exist.”

Naya Rivera and Ryan Dorsey are working things out.

The Glee star and her estranged husband reached a custody agreement in regards to their 2-year-old son, Josey, according to court documents obtained by ET.

In papers filed on Dec. 22, the couple has agreed to share 50/50 joint custody and shall consult one another on all major decision relating to their son's health, education and welfare. The documents also state that they will equally divide all holidays and vacations with their son.

Things between Rivera and Dorsey, 34, began to go south again after the actress was arrested in Kanawha County, West Virginia, on Nov. 25 and charged with domestic battery against her husband. According to a spokesperson for the Kanawha County Sheriff’s Office, the two were arguing over their child.

"Caitlyn Jenner Opens Up About ‘Tough’ Relationship With Her Kids
Caitlyn Jenner is opening up about the difficulty of maintaining a relationship with her kids following her gender transition, the mistakes she’s made in her journey and how she once thought the only time she would get to publicly wear woman’s clothing would be in her coffin.



The 68-year-old reality television star pours her heart out during a new profile for Broadly, in which she discusses her strained family relationships.

“I spend a lot of time by myself here in the house,” she tells transgender journalist Diana Tourjee. “I have a lot of children, but sometimes just because of circumstances, maintaining a close relationship with your kids is very tough. They all have lives. They’ve all moved on.”

“We’re just human beings; we’re going to be here for a very short time,” Caitlyn adds. “We come and we go and at the end, when it’s all said and done, hopefully your family is going to be there.”

Caitlyn also goes into detail about her initial plans to complete a gender transition by the time she turned 40, in 1989, only to get started, then backtrack, after she and then-wife, Kris Jenner, welcomed their daughter, Kendall, in 1995.

According to the article, Caitlyn underwent more than four years of hormone therapy and had developed “a little B-cup” by the time she met Kris (who denied knowing that Caitlyn -- who went by Bruce at the time -- was transgender when they met, during an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians).

""When Kendall was born, I had liposuction and got rid of [my breasts],” explains Caitlyn, who welcomed a second daughter, Kylie, with Kris in 1997, and has four other children from previous relationships. “Because I thought, ‘I can’t even go swimming with my kid.’”

Golden Globes 2018 review: Seth Meyers, Oprah Winfrey hit all the right notes

Show Caption Hide Caption Hear the power of Oprah Winfrey's Golden Globes speech Oprah Winfrey got multiple standing ovations for her moving Golden Globes acceptance speech on women, equality, sexual harassment and more. She was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement. USA TODAY

It was always going to be a different kind of awards show.

How could the 2018 Golden Globes — the first major awards since Hollywood was rocked to its core by a series of sexual harassment, assault and misconduct allegations — be business as usual? It was different starting with the red carpet, where nominees and others wore black as a symbol of protest and solidarity with harassment victims. So how do you follow that up with a monologue?

Host Seth Meyers, at least, had it mostly figured out.

NBC's Late Night host took the stage for the first time at the traditionally loose and boozy awards ceremony, kicking off an awards season in the middle of a cultural upheaval. It's not exactly a task that comes with a playbook, as he playfully noted when he shouted out to the ""hosts of other upcoming award shows who are watching me like the first dog shot into outer space.""

More: Live from the 2018 Golden Globes

If the other hosts were nervous for Meyers, they shouldn't have been. The comedian managed to find just the right tone for his quick opening monologue, which moved easily between smart (and appropriate) jokes about the sexual harassment allegations to the usual jests about the year's crop of nominees to a frequent recipient of his barbs, President Trump.

After kicking off with a pointed ""Good evening ladies and remaining gentlemen,"" Meyers addressed the allegations head on, rather than skirting around the topic. Some of the jokes didn't land entirely, including one criticizing Kevin Spacey, who has been accus","0"

On Thursday, Schumer shared photos from the event on her Instagram. The bride wore a Monique Lhuillier gown picked just four days before the ceremony, her stylist tells PEOPLE.

The announcement comes just days after the Trainwreck star and chef made their relationship social-media official with a kissing photo on Instagram Sunday.

Harvey Weinstein timeline: How the scandal has unfolded

24 February 2023 Share Save Share Save

Reuters The disgraced film producer was sentenced to 23 years in jail after his trial in New York

Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of rape and sexual assault by courts in New York and Los Angeles.

Here is a summary of the key events that led him to court:

5 October 2017

The New York Times publishes a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd are among the women who come forward.

Among the accusations are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. He also promised to help advance their careers in return for sexual favours.

Weinstein issues an apology acknowledging he ""has caused a lot of pain"" - but disputes allegations he harassed female employees over nearly three decades.

Weinstein says he is taking a ""leave of absence"" from The Weinstein Company and is working with a therapist.

8 October 2017

It is announced that Harvey Weinstein has been sacked by the board of his company, with immediate effect. They say the decision was made ""in light of new information about misconduct"".

9 October 2017

British actress Romola Garai tells the Guardian that she felt ""violated"" when Weinstein auditioned her as an 18-year-old, saying that he had answered the door to his hotel room in a bathrobe.

10 October 2017

Allegations from 13 more women are published in the New Yorker magazine, including three accusations of rape, which Weinstein strongly denies.

Actress Asia Argento and a former aspiring actress named Lucia Stoller say Weinstein forced himself on them sexually. A third woman withholds her name from the article, the result of a 10-month investigation by the magazine. Argento says the incident happened in 1997 in the south of France while Stoller, who now goes under the name Evans, says she was fo","0"

"Duchess Kate's Nautical Style Is Surprisingly Affordable

Duchess Kate is a fan of high-end fashion brands like Alexander McQueen, Emilia Wickstead, and Jenny Packham, but even she can't resist a great deal from Zara or J.Crew.

Last week, the Duchess of Cambridge visited the 1851 Trust, an organization that gives young people the chance to experience sailing, while also encouraging an interest in the environment and the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. In honor of the organization's focus on boating, the Duchess went all out in a nautical-themed look, and fortunately for us, it's one outfit that won't break the bank...that is, if you can get your hands on the pieces.

Kate's wide-leg sailor-inspired trousers with gold detailing are from J.Crew, and while they have already sold out, like everything the Duchess touches, J.Crew's factory site has a look-a-like style in stock.

Her tweed, pointy-toe heels, also from J.Crew, have sold out as well, but you can still shop Kate's Superga sneakers, which she changed into before stepping aboard the ship.

The sleek single-button white blazer is a piece that Kate's worn once before, while on the Royal Tour of Canada last fall. The older style is from Zara, and while it's no longer available, here's a similar jacket from J.Crew, and another from Nordstrom.

Finally, the simple jewelry Kate wore for the event is still available, though at two drastically different price points. For those on a budget, take a look at Kate's much-beloved Mirabelle Lolita earrings; they'll cost you just £35. Her Ballon Bleu de Cartier watch, on the other hand? They start around $4,600.","0"

"Stranger Things Co-Stars Spark More Dating Rumors in Paris
Romance rumors are flying around Stranger Things stars Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer once again. This isn’t the first time the two have made fans wonder about their relationship; the IRL Nancy and Jonathan, who had crushes on each other in the show, have been rumored to be dating since early 2017, but still haven’t confirmed it.

Over the weekend, photographers snapped Charlie and Natalia holding hands on a leisurely stroll together in Paris. They shared a pair of earbuds and were also spotted with Charlie’s arm comfortably around Natalia’s shoulders. A cozy autumn walk around Paris is looking pretty good right now.

Holding hands obviously does not equal relationship, but fans are still thrilled about a possible pairing between the two stars.

"Asia Argento's Cryptic Post Before Bourdain's Death
In the hours before news broke of Anthony Bourdain's apparent suicide, his girlfriend Asia Argento was active on social media.

The 42-year-old Italian actress shared videos and photos on her Instagram story throughout the day on Thursday, including one with the Rome geotag, seemingly indicating she was not in the same country as Bourdain at the time of his death. The host of CNN's Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, who was 61, was found unresponsive in his hotel room in France on Friday morning by close friend and French chef, Eric Ripert, according to CNN. Both were filming an upcoming episode of Bourdain's award-winning show.

Argento's recent Instagram story, posted around three hours before Bourdain's death was first reported, was a photo of herself wearing a ripped t-shirt that read: ""F— EVERYONE.""

""You know who you are,"" she captioned the post.

Argento's Instagram story has since been deleted.

Argento has since released a statement regarding Bourdain on Twitter. ""Anthony gave all of himself in everything that he did,"" she said. ""His brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspired so many, and his generosity knew no bounds. He was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated. My thoughts are with his family. I would ask that you respect their privacy and mine.""

A Strasbourg police spokesperson confirmed Bourdain's death to PEOPLE. Colmar, France, public prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny du Fayel told PEOPLE that Bourdain died by hanging at a luxury hotel in Kaysersberg called Le Chambard, noting ""at this stage, nothing suggests the intervention of a third party.""

""It is with extraordinary sadness we can confirm the death of our friend and colleague, Anthony Bourdain,"" CNN said in a statement.

"Keira Knightley on ‘Colette,’ Pushing for Social Change, and if She’ll Ever Direct
Keira Knightley speaks her mind.

While most movie stars frequently offer up anodyne responses to reporters’ inquiries and deploy an army of publicists and image makers to ensure they never say anything remotely controversial, Knightley refuses to dodge tough questions. She’s ostensibly talking to Variety about “Colette,” a historical drama centering on the legendary French novelist that will premiere Jan. 20 at the Sundance Film Festival, but Knightley is more comfortable holding forth on the topical subjects of feminism, sexism and the lack of opportunities for female directors than she is talking about her creative process.

That’s what makes the 32-year-old actress a natural fit for the title role in the indie production. The mononymous Colette, perhaps best known for her novella “Gigi,” was a barrier breaker. A woman who had romances with women and men, and who rose to the top of belle époque society by writing stories, such as “Chéri” and the Claudine novels, that had a refreshing sexual candor. But some glass ceilings proved difficult to shatter for the literary sensation. She was involved in an exploitative relationship with her husband, a writer known as Willy (played in the film by Dominic West), who passed Colette’s work off as his own, reaping both the critical acclaim and financial rewards for himself.

Popular on Variety

Nadav Kander for Variety

“Colette” hits Sundance looking for a U.S. distributor. It should attract interest from buyers thanks to Knightley’s compelling central performance — and because it’s a portrait of a feminist pioneer that seems tailor-made for the #MeToo and #TimesUp moments.

“It’s definitely hashtag Colette too,” says director and co-writer Wash Westmoreland. “Her story of a man trying to shut up a woman and a woman being stifled by a man’s ego is still going on today and has been going on throughout history. There have been seismic changes a","0"

"Another YouTube star took a video of a dead body in a Japanese 'suicide forest'
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

A YouTube celebrity is being widely criticized for filming a dead body in Japan's Aokigahara forest, less than a year after Logan Paul got in trouble for the same stunt.

The video, posted by Qorygore, a YouTube star with about 800,000 followers who's popular in Indonesia for his videos about gaming and rap. It showed him vlogging from the ""suicide forest"" Aokigahara, famous for being the site of a disproportionate number of suicides. Qorygore found what he said was a dead body covered by a raincoat and included it in his video.

The video received nearly 600,000 views before YouTube removed it, according to the Indonesia-based publication Coconuts Jakarta.

""I went all the way to Japan. This is Logan Paul 2.0,"" he said in the video according to The Daily Dot.

YouTube star Logan Paul infamously pulled the same stunt in December 2017. He included a video of a dead body in the forest as part of a longer controversial vlog about Japan. YouTube ultimately punished Paul for the video, limiting his advertising revenue and removing him from a number of projects reserved for Youtube celebrities. Paul apologized for it.

On Wednesday, the “Find You” singer, 25, was photographed kissing a woman, identified as Annalisa Azaredo, in her native Australia.

But, a source tells PEOPLE, “it’s just a fling.”

"‘The Keepers’: Here’s What Has Happened Since the Netflix Series Debuted
Netflix’s “The Keepers” debuted two months ago, and since then, filmmaker Ryan White has seen positive developments in the case: More victims have spoken out and police are investigating further into Father Joseph Maskell’s past life.

“I am seeing that ‘The Keepers’ is having a positive impact, not just in the sense that more victims have come forward but it is also having a positive impact in showing people that they aren’t alone and that it’s possible to move forward and confront your painful past,” White told TheWrap during a recent interview.

White said that many new victims have come out of the woodwork since the series was released: “A lot of people watched the series and realized that they weren’t the only ones and now have the courage to talk about it. Hopefully, it will lead to a lot of healing.”

There has also been a lot of movement in terms of investigating Maskell. “The Keepers” explores the murder of Sister Catherine Cesnik, who disappeared in November 1969 and whose body was discovered in January of 1970. The documentary investigates whether Maskell had Sister Cathy killed because she was about to expose him and others for sexual abusing teenage students at Archbishop Keough High School. Maskell died in 2001, and until his death, he had denied the allegations.

According to CNN, Father Maskell’s body was exhumed in February to see whether his DNA matched the DNA from the murder scene. Two days before “The Keepers” was released, Baltimore County Police found that the DNA profile did not match.

“No one’s prevailing theory was that his DNA would be there,” White added, referring to many people’s idea that Maskell ordered the murder but himself did not orchestrate it. “It’s a huge outward sign that they are taking Maskell seriously as a suspect now, and it definitely begs the question why these tests weren’t done when he was alive and Jean Wehner [Jane Doe] was coming forward.

"Teen Mom: Catelynn Baltierra Unleashes Divorce Fears
Catelynn Baltierra lived in fear that her husband Tyler Baltierra would want to divorce her when she revealed her need to return to rehab to deal with childhood trauma.

The Teen Mom OG star, 26, shared her feelings with Tyler on the season finale of the MTV reality series, telling him she needed to seek treatment again just days after she’d returned from rehab for suicidal thoughts.

“It’s super hard for me to tell you this thing, so keep an open mind,” Catelynn began. “I’ve started to have really bad anxiety in the mornings but I’ve been hiding it. I just feel like I’ve been letting people down for some reason. I feel guilty [by having anxiety]. Obviously, my meds aren’t working. I have to force myself to get in the shower and put makeup on.”

Tyler, who has also struggled with depression, expressed his self-doubt, telling Catelynn, “It’s gotta be something with me.”

“No! It has nothing to do with you Tyler. It’s my inner childhood s—,” Catelynn told him. “I’m telling you right now, it’s nothing to do with what you do. It’s me being a f—— 12-year-old and my dad leaving or me being 8 and my mom drinking all the time and not being there.”

“It’s my own s—, it’s just coming out with thing going on in life. It’s nothing to do with you, you’re awesome, you’re supportive,” she continued.

Catelynn added that she was certain she needed to seek treatment again as Tyler looked at her and struggled to keep a supportive front.

“I didn’t even want to tell you that I was going back,” Catelynn said. “I just thought, ‘I wouldn’t blame Tyler, like seriously, if you wanted to just divorce me.’ I put you through so much. You’re an awesome husband, seriously, to stand by me through all this s—. I’m sure a lot of guys would just throw in the f—— towel.”

Sonja Morgan is not taking no for an answer when it comes to selling her NYC townhouse ... because TMZ has learned she's just put it back on the market!

Real estate sources tell us the 'RHONY' star is listing her Upper East Side townhouse for $8.75 million. Sonja initially listed it way back in 2013 for $9.95 million amid her divorce from J.P. Morgan heir John A. Morgan.

The 4-bedroom home has seen a lot of changes since then because we're told Sonja has given it a complete makeover over the years.

She had an offer in 2017, but turned it down because her daughter needed stability at home amid the divorce -- she would frequently bring friends home from boarding school, so they still needed the space.

As we've reported, she listed the 5-story townhouse for the 7th time in 2017 for around $10 mil ... still, to no avail.

Someone's missing out ... all the bedrooms feature wood-burning fireplaces, and there's also an elevator, sauna, gym, and terrace -- all sitting in the ritzy Madison Ave and Central Park neighborhood.

In January 2020, Sonja had an $11.75 million cash offer, but the buyer ended up dropping out in February when the pandemic began. Then, for a period of time, she couldn't show the home because of COVID.

After the lockdown lifted in the city, she rented the home to a family from Spain, before renting it out to a new tenant, for 32k a month. We're told, the tenant recently moved out.

Now, Sonja is back at it ... determined to get the pad rented again, or sold for the asking price.","0"

The web giant also compiled the most-asked questions typed into their search engine since the announcement was made on Monday morning.

When is the baby due? Will he or she have a title? And how will the child fit into the line of succession? Here are the answers everyone is looking for.

1. When is royal baby due?

The Kensington Palace Twitter account broke the news by saying Meghan “is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019”. For those looking for a more precise time, she is believed to have already had her 12-week scan so those close to the couple are expecting the birth some time in April.

2. How old is Meghan Markle?

Meghan is 37 years old, three years older than her husband Harry.

3. When did Harry and Meghan get married?

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on May 19 this year. On the same day they were given the titles Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

The event was hailed as a joyous combination of tradition and modernity, bringing a gospel choir and rousing address from American preacher Bishop Michael Curry to the gothic surrounds of the 15th Century St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.

4. Which royal is having a baby?

#RoyalBaby has been trending on social media for much of Monday morning, but not everyone would have seen the original announcement.

So to do away with any doubt, the only royal who we know for sure to be expecting a baby is Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.

"Lisa Kudrow Makes Her Debut in ‘Grace and Frankie’ Season 4 Trailer
It’s three’s company when Grace and Frankie are joined by newcomer Lisa Kudrow in season four.

Netflix released the official trailer for the returning comedy starring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, and the first look shows Kudrow making her debut as Grace’s (Fonda) longtime manicurist, Sheree. Sheree greets Frankie (Tomlin) with a hug, to which Grace’s protective best pal deadpans, “It’s a good thing I’m not allergic to rhinestones.” But she is quickly left stunned by their friendship and asking, “What the hell is going on here?” The arrival of Sheree is set to irk Frankie and threaten to drive a wedge between her and Grace as the season progresses.

Kudrow’s arrival as a recurring star also marks a Friends reunion with creator Marta Kauffman. The pair have not worked together since the NBC comedy wrapped in 2004.

The trailer also hints at further upheaval to come, as Grace’s and Frankie’s ex-husbands turned lovers, Sol (Sam Waterston) and Robert (Martin Sheen), are having marital problems. Their therapist suggests they try an open marriage.

Meanwhile, partners in crime Grace and Frankie remain partners in business as well, as Grace is shown continuing to sell their now-recognizable purple vibrators, which are targeted to women who, like 70somethings Grace and Frankie, desire to explore their sexuality at any age. The pair continue their usual shenanigans, but also appear to be in denial about their health, spurring their kids to stage what appears to be an intervention.

The Emmy-nominated comedy also stars Brooklyn Decker, June Diane Raphael, Ethan Embry, Baron Vaughn. Ernie Hudson returns as Frankie’s boyfriend and Peter Gallagher is also back as a potential love interest for Grace.

"‘Bachelor in Paradise’ Star Says Scandal Wouldn’t Have Happened If He Were White
Millions of viewers were anxiously awaiting the premiere of Bachelor in Paradise, but DeMario Jackson was personally invested in how the TV saga would play out.

Speaking candidly to The Hollywood Reporter, Jackson says he feels “relieved” now that the ABC summer spinoff series has addressed the controversy that featured him and fellow contestant, Corinne Olympios, in the leading roles off-camera for nearly two months this summer.

“I think people wanted it to be something different,” Jackson, 30, who is black, says of his on-set encounter with Olympios, 25, a white contestant. “They wanted the angry black guy and this little, innocent white girl. But it wasn’t that.”

The moment in question was a taped sexual encounter between the two contestants, who had both been drinking, that occurred in the hot tub at the show’s Sayulita, Mexico, resort. A producer, who according to Jackson never saw the moment or the footage, filed a misconduct allegation, forcing producers Warner Bros. Television to suspend production to investigate. A second producer later filed a similar complaint. After nearly two weeks, where an outside firm watched all footage and interviewed the entire cast and crew, WBTV concluded there was no wrongdoing and the show resumed filming, this time without Jackson or Olympios.

Before the cast officially kicked off the second round of Paradise, they sat down with host Chris Harrison to discuss what happened, placing blame on inaccurate reporting and clearing the show’s producers of any culpability. The scandal, they agreed, blew up into a national sensation because of vague statements and quick assumptions, largely motivated by race.

"The Americans finale recap: “START” ends the series brilliantly
Every week, some of Vox’s writers gather to discuss the latest episode of FX’s spy drama The Americans. This week, critic at large Todd VanDerWerff, news editor Libby Nelson, senior writer Dylan Matthews, and deputy culture editor Genevieve Koski offer their takes on “START,” the series finale. Needless to say, spoilers follow!

Todd VanDerWerff: After six seasons and 75 episodes of longing and spy games and dark twists and turns, The Americans finally revealed its core self in “START,” and that core self was an unabashed romantic, with a side of icy cold tragedy.

Philip and Elizabeth live. They don’t just live; they escape to the Soviet Union to begin a new life together there as Mischa and Nadezhda. But both of their children stay behind in the US — Paige by choice and Henry completely unknowingly. Stan finds out the truth about his neighbors. He confronts them in a parking garage and pulls a gun on them — but ultimately lets them go. Oleg rots away for years to come in an American prison cell. Renée is maybe a spy, or maybe she’s not.

Oh, yeah, and Philip and Elizabeth save the world, bringing news of the attempted coup against Gorbachev back with them to the Soviet Union. It’s not depicted onscreen, but this, I assume, is why the two end up in a car with Arkady, the one character from the show’s past to make an appearance in this finale. There’s a fitting symmetry here — the Jennings marriage is saved, and so is the world. The two were more reliant on each other than we ever might have guessed.

As both a series finale and an episode of The Americans, “START” is a terrific achievement. For starters, it’s a beautiful showcase for the show’s main players. (The little gasp Keri Russell gives when Elizabeth realizes leaving Henry in the US is the right call is Emmy-worthy in itself.) But it also somehow ties off every story thread that matters, and it ties off most of them in vastly unexpected ways. A","0"
"Tarek & Christina El Moussa Mourn Death of Flip or Flop Contractor
Tarek and Christina El Moussa are mourning the loss of a dear friend.

The two HGTV stars shared their condolences and memories of Frank Miller, a contractor for their show Flip or Flop, who passed away on Friday.

Miller suffered from Laryngeal cancer.

""Good bye My dear friend Frank,"" Tarek wrote in the caption of a photo of the two of them. ""I have always looked up to you and have respected you as a brother.""

""You have touched not only myself and my family but thousands and thousands around the world,"" he continued. ""You have impacted so many lives with the fight inside your heart and soul. I've never met anyone like you nor will I ever. I just love you love you love you more than you know! I will NEVER forget you and I hope to one day be as strong as you. Now…don't slack!!!! I assume you are already working on remodeling heaven!!!!:):). Miss you buddy!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️""

Christina, 34, also shared a photo of herself and Miller, writing, ""Frank since the day I met you I had the utmost respect for you. Hardworking and REAL. Always a pleasure to be around and always made me laugh. You fought your hardest!! You are so admired and respected by all who know you. God has a special place for you in Heaven. Love you and miss you❤️ #RIP.""

In the episode of The Doctors, which aired in September, Miller said it was Tarek who noticed something was off about his health.

""A couple of years ago, we were filming [Flip or Flop] and my voice started to get scratchy,"" Miller said.

Tarek recalled how Miller began losing his voice and clearing his throat.

""It brought back memories of what I went through, which really scared me for him, which pushed me to make sure that he got it checked out,"" said Tarek, 36.

The HGTV host began raising money for his friend in June, when he shared a photo of Miller from a hospital bed. The father of two donated $5,000 to Miller's GoFundMe page.

"Diane von Furstenberg Thinks Viagra Is ‘The Worst Thing’
Diane von Furstenberg. Photo: Darren Gerrish/WireImage

According to Diane von Furstenberg, Viagra is the “worst thing that has happened to women in the last 15 years.” In a new interview with The Times, the legendary fashion designer said that it used to be that men weren’t really fathering children after 65, but now, “Now, with Viagra … they just feel…”

“For men it used to be all about getting it up. ‘Did I?’ ‘Can I?’ There was a certain fairness,” she said. “A woman couldn’t have a child after 40, right? Though even that doesn’t exist any more.”

DVF also shared that she and her husband have separate residences in New York, and that in L.A., she often sleeps in the guest bedroom because her husband “sleeps with two dogs inside the bed.”

Von Furstenberg’s sentiments about Viagra extend to her approach to aging in general: She just wants us all to stop fighting against time. “Age means you have lived,” she said. “I am 71, but I should be 140 I have lived so fully.” She added that she finds it “humiliating” that women in their 30s try to shy away from embracing their age and dislikes the fact that “even young girls [are] doing things to their faces.”

Hopefully we all can embrace aging as enthusiastically as Diane von Furstenberg.","0"

"Kendall Jenner’s 2017 Met Gala Dress Was Made With 85,000 Crystals & Zero Fabric
If there's anyone that knows how to make a sartorial statement, it the Kardashian-Jenner family. Whether they're walking down the street or stepping onto the red carpet, these women always look great. And this time is no different. Kendall Jenner wore a crystal dress to the 2017 Met Gala. As in, it was made out of nothing but 85,000 crystals. It comes as no surprise that she nailed yet another red carpet ensemble, but this might just be her most unconventional look yet.

The model typically sticks to cutouts on the Met Gala red carpet. It seems like every year the cutouts get more and more intricate too. But, with this year's theme being Rei Kawakubo — aka all about the fabric — Jenner amped up her look to do the exact opposite. She stepped onto the red carpet in a La Perla Haute Couture Collection gown designed by Creative Director Julia Haart that was made but nothing but 85,000 hand painted and placed crystals. Basically, it's the chicest net you'll ever see walk the red carpet.

Jenner kept the rest of the look simple. Because when you're wearing nothing but accessories, you don't need to wear any. This look is definitely a piece of art to say the least. But don't just take me word for it. Here's the full head-to-toe look, so you can take it all in.

"Dakota Meyer
U.S. Marine Medal of Honor recipient

Dakota Louis Meyer (born June 26, 1988)[1] is a current United States Marine. A veteran of the War in Afghanistan, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Ganjgal on September 8, 2009, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. Meyer is the second-youngest living Medal of Honor recipient, the third living recipient for either the Iraq War or the War in Afghanistan,[2] and the first living United States Marine in 38 years to be honored.[3]

Early life and education [ edit ]

Meyer was born and grew up in Columbia, Kentucky, the son of Felicia Carole Ferree ""Killy"" Gilliam and Michael Allen Meyer.[4][5]

In 2006, Dakota Meyer graduated from Green County High School. While at Green County High School he had walked up to a recruiting United States Marine Corps sergeant visiting from about an hour's drive away. The sergeant was sitting in the school's lunchroom and asked him what he planned to do after high school. Meyer told the recruiter, ""I'm going to go to college and play college football."" The reply stung as the Marine sergeant said that he would do the same thing if he was Meyer because there was no way that he could become a Marine.

After first walking off, Meyer came back five minutes later with his answer, ""If you pack up your stuff right now I'll go sign the papers."" He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps at a recruiting station in Louisville, Kentucky and went to boot camp at Parris Island.[4][6]

Military service [ edit ]

Meyer deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in 2007 as a scout sniper with 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. He gained national attention for his actions in Afghanistan during his second deployment in Kunar Province with Embedded Training Team 2–8.[7][8]

"Why Michael B. Jordan Wanted to Only Audition for Roles Written for White Men
During their interview for Variety‘s “Actors on Actors,” presented by Shutterstock, “Fahrenheit 451” star Michael B. Jordan told “Insecure’s” Issa Rae that after he finished working on “Fruitvale Station,” he told his agents that he didn’t want to audition for roles written for African-Americans.

“I said, I don’t want it. I want to only go for, like, [roles written for] white males. That’s it,” he said. “Me playing that role is going to make it what it is. I don’t want any pre-bias on the character.”

Peter Yang for Variety

Rae also opened up about the positive change that seems to be overtaking Hollywood’s perception of what a leading actress looks like following the success of movies like “Black Panther.” She that said early on in her career, her agents would send roles to her that Rae doubted she’d be able to land because of her race.

“If it were a leading woman of a certain type, I just knew the type that they would go for, so I’m just not going to even bother,” Rae said. “People have been receptive. Even just the confidence that a movie like [“Black Panther”] and other films by other filmmakers of color that have come out have really just changed what people perceive as a leading lady, as the beautiful person, the daring or the bold action-adventure type. That just feels so dope to me.”

"Kit Harington says he won’t star in any Game of Thrones spinoffs, because duh
Kit Harington (Jon Snow) has plans for what he wants to do after Game of Thrones is over. He wants to be in a boxing movie, for example, before he gets too old, but be will not be appearing in any of the multiple Game of Thrones spinoff shows HBO is planning. “I think there’s going to be spinoffs,” he said in the March issue of Italian GQ, “but I’m not going to be involved in any of it.”

Still, he wishes the network the best, and sees an upside to the fact that none of the current cast members will appear on the new shows, all of which are planned as prequels to the main story. “The great thing about ‘Thrones’ for HBO is that you can sell it in a totally different way,” he said. “You could set it 300 years earlier and save a load of money because we [the cast] are very expensive now.”

At the moment, Harington, Emilia Clarke (Daenerys), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion), Lena Headey (Cersei) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jamie) all make between $500k and $1.1 million per episode, so he could have a point.

Harington also remembered the heady early days before he commanded that kind of paycheck, and revealed the clincher that made him accept the role of Jon Snow in the first place, despite not fully understanding the show at first:

""It was HBO, and that’s all that really mattered to me. It was, and is, a staple of quality. But the script? I didn’t really understand it. I read it twice and thought, This is the most bizarre thing ever. I don’t quite get why they’re doing it, but I’m in. I do remember reading my role and thinking, This is in my locker – I can do this. Grumpy. Quiet. Solid. That’s fine. I can do that.""

Yes, we think he’s nailed the grumpy quiet solid act by now.

Harington named season 2 as the most significant year for him, since that was when “we realized it was a show that was successful, we were suddenly in this incredible location – and I was with the girl that I fell in love with.”","0"

CNN —

Amelia Gray Hamlin, the daughter of actors Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin, took to Instagram on Sunday to reveal that she struggled with anorexia.

The 16-year-old model posted two photos of herself wearing swimsuits. Hamlin explained in the caption that the first photo is recent, while the other is from last year when she was suffering from anorexia. Hamlin looked visibly thinner in the second photo.

“Last year at this time there was no doubt that I was not okay,” Hamlin wrote in the captiom. “Not only physically but also mentally. I feel like sometimes people forget that just because your job involves being in front of the camera, doesn’t mean you can’t have bad days. We’re human. All of us.”

Hamlin said she hopes that others will benefit from reading about her struggles.

“I went through this journey not for attention, not for people to pitty [sic] me, but to help,” she said. “I am on this earth to help people, and I know that.”

Hamlin also told fans that she suffers from “health complications” as a result of her years long battle with anorexia. She said that she was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder that attacks the thyroid gland.

“I have a lot of health complications after starving myself for so long so it’s going to be a journey that I go through for a large part of my life … not to say that recently being diagnosed with Hashimoto’s has also been an extreme challenge for me to balance when still getting over this part of my life, but I am getting there.

"Ellen DeGeneres Puts Seth Meyers Through Awards Show Boot Camp
As he prepares for his upcoming hosting gig at Sunday’s Golden Globe Awards, Seth Meyers had his skills put to the test on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where the daytime host put him through an awards show boot camp.

“Anything could go wrong. Things happen,” DeGeneres told Meyers during his visit to her show Wednesday. Devising a game plan for possible hiccups, DeGeneres instructed Meyers to read the teleprompter, while dealing with various distractions.

Prior to DeGeneres’ test, Meyers revealed that he is somewhat nervous for Sunday night’s show, in particular being in front of some of Hollywood’s biggest stars. “At least some of them have been on my show … But you’d rather you didn’t recognize them,” Meyers joked. “I would rather look out into a room full of strangers, as opposed to movie stars.”

The Late Night host also joked that it would be awkward if he saw a future guest find his Globes jokes not funny. “Because, they’ve watched me watch them not crack a smile.” DeGeneres then asked when the host would begin drinking during the ceremony, to which Meyers joked “right after the opening monologue.”

Later on, Meyers revealed that his 2-year-old son is a pro at celebrating Hanukkah after mumbling his own prayer during their family’s candle lighting. Meyers, who is expecting his second child, shared that he and his wife will be having another boy. Explaining that he loves that his son will have a sibling best friend, like he does, Meyers then joked that his feelings could be one-sided. “My brother doesn’t even say it. He doesn’t care for me at all. I’m clingy.”","0"

Kelis, Nas' Ex-Wife, Accuses Rapper Of Physical And Mental Abuse

Enlarge this image toggle caption Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Spotify Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Spotify

For nearly a decade, singer and celebrity chef Kelis kept the details surrounding her divorce from the rap artist Nas private. But in a new video interview with Hollywood Unlocked, she describes their high-profile celebrity marriage of five years as a ""tumultuous and toxic"" relationship in which she suffered both mental and physical abuse.

""I have edited myself for nine years and I woke up this morning and said, 'not today,' "" Kelis says during the nearly two-hour interview recorded at her home.

A representative for Nas did not respond to a request for comment.

When the couple married in 2005, Nas's status as one of the greatest rappers alive and Kelis's genre-bending musical repertoire made them instant hip-hop royalty in the public eye. Yet the fairy-tale was far from reality, Kelis claims. She describes a marriage in which they fought frequently, with Nas often drinking to the point of being black-out drunk before becoming violent toward her. Kelis would fight back in self-defense, she says, and Nas would often wake up with no memory of the events. ""Literally, we would have the worst night ever and we would wake up the next day, and it's like it never happened.""

Her revelations come amid the backdrop of #MeToo, a movement whose greater reckoning around sexual assault, harassment and violence against women has yet to make a dent in hip-hop, despite its tangled, misogynist history. Russell Simmons, the godfather of the rap industry, has been the subject of multiple allegations of sexual assault and harassment over the past year; one of two assault cases filed against Simmons was dropped earlier this week. But the music industry, and hip-hop in particular, has yet to face the wide-scale scru","0"

Show Caption Hide Caption Terry Crews files assault and battery lawsuit against WME 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' star Terry Crews has filed an assault and battery lawsuit against WME and agent Adam Venit, who Crews claims violated him at a party in Hollywood in 2016. USA TODAY

Terry Crews is suing the Hollywood agent he accused of groping him last year at an industry event.

After filing a complaint with the LAPD last month, Crews has launched a lawsuit against William Morris Endeavor agent Adam Venit for assault, battery and sexual harassment, among other charges. He is also suing the talent agency.

After Crews made his allegation public on Twitter in October (though not naming Venit specifically), the former motion picture head was identified in trade publications and suspended from WME. Venit returned to the company in a demoted role about a month later.

More: Terry Crews opens up about alleged assault: 'I have never felt more emasculated'

The ""blatant"" groping occurred on Feb. 4, 2016, according to the complaint obtained by USA TODAY, at an industry event hosted by Adam Sandler.

Having never met the Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor previously, ""Venit stared at Crews intently, like a rabid dog, sticking his tongue in and out of his mouth provocatively,"" according to the suit.

What followed was allegedly physical. ""Venit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews’ penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain.""

The suit says Crews shoved Venit back ""knocking him into several people who were standing nearby"" causing the actor to yell out. But Venit ""continued to leer at Crews, provocatively wagging his tongue again, and then grabbed and squeezed Crews’ genitals again."" Crews states he asked the nearby Sandler, with whom he had appeared in several films, for help.

"Joanna Gaines on Why Expecting Her Fifth Baby 'Feels Like It's My First Time Being Pregnant'
Joanna Gaines may be expecting her fifth child with husband Chip Gaines, but this pregnancy is specifically very special for their entire family.

“Since it’s been over eight years since I was pregnant with [daughter Emmie Kay, 7] I joke with my friends that it feels like it’s my first time being pregnant,” Joanna, 39, wrote in a letter to fans ahead of the series finale of their HGTV show Fixer Upper on Tuesday.

“The best thing about all of this is the excitement that my kids have shown for their new baby brother. Since I had our first four babies so close to one another, none of them actually remember me being pregnant,” revealed the mother-to-be, who also said “pregnancy has been so fun” because she loves to “take naps and eat” this time around.

“They love my growing belly (and boy is it growing), and they cannot wait to meet him. I truly believe this baby is a gift from God for our family in this season,” she said of her sons Duke, 9, and Drake, 12, plus daughters Ella, 11, and Emmie Kay.

“If you would have told me that I’d end this season of the show pregnant with our fifth baby, I would’ve laughed,” said Joanna, who announced she was expecting in January, two months before revealing she and Chip will be welcoming a baby boy.

“The entire Fixer Upper opportunity as a whole, life has a way of surprising us. With our little ones getting bigger, we had this gut feeling that it was time to step back and focus on them and our businesses here in Waco, Texas,” she continued.

“And although that’s why we thought we decided to step away from the show, we now realize with this little one on the way that there was a bigger plan in place for us all along,” the Magnolia Table cookbook author concluded.

"Riverdale: Clifford Blossom Killed Jason Blossom
Jason Blossom's murderer has been found and it was a deeply chilling reveal for Riverdale fans.

It turns out that Clifford Blossom (Barclay Hope) is the one who pulled the trigger on his own son. A hidden flash drive found in Jason's (Trevor Stines) varsity jacket revealed footage from the Whyte Wyrm's basement that confirmed Clifford Blossom shot his own son in the head.

It took several twists and turns to get to the truth, though. The first gut punch was FP Jones (Skeet Ulrich) confessing to the crime Archie (KJ Apa) and his friends knew he didn't commit. Then Hal Cooper (Lochlyn Munro) dropped the bomb that his grandfather was actually a Blossom -- meaning that Polly (Tiera Skovbye) and Jason are actually related.

Cole Sprouse, Casey Cott and Camilla Mendes, Riverdale Bettina Strauss, Bettina Strauss/The CW

Betty (Lili Reinhart) immediately assumed the incest was motive for the Blossoms to kill their own son. This put her a lot closer to the truth than Archie and Veronica (Camilla Mendes), who continued on their mission to find out if Veronica's imprisoned father, Hiram Lodge, had any connection to the brutal murder. It turns out that Veronica's father is guilty of many things, but murder isn't one of them.

Meanwhile, it turns out FP confessed because Clifford had threatened to harm Jughead (Cole Sprouse) if he didn't take the rap for the crime. While the sheriff knows who really pulled the trigger, FP still has to do time for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice, which leaves Jughead without a parental unit and staying with the Andrews until further notice.

"The Hills Producers Finally Tell Us What Was Real & What Was Fake
“There are things the cast does not want to talk about, like Lauren and the sex tape. As producers, for us the challenge is getting access to what we know is the real story. Lauren would forever say, ‘I’m not mentioning Heidi’s name,’ or, ‘I’m not doing the show if she’s on the show.’ We were so sympathetic to that, but at the same time, you had Heidi wanting to make up with Lauren, still wanting to be a part of the show. And [you had] the sex tape rumors that Lauren didn’t want to talk about, yet that was a betrayal that was so important and such a big elephant in the room that we just had to work with Lauren and say, ‘Alright, so what are we going to do? We are going to have to access this somehow.’ It’s always a discussion… Lauren didn’t want to confront Heidi. That was a catch-the-drama moment. As reality TV producers, we are hoping these two [will] meet up, you know? We were lucky enough to be there at the nightclub where we thought Heidi and Spencer might show up. We knew Lauren was there, and I think we knew they might show up.”“I don’t want to get into the specifics of [the sex tape rumors] just because that’s their story, but from what we got on tape, it all just kind of came to a head at that nightclub.

Ansel and Violetta's romance began when Violetta, unaware that Ansel went to the same school as her, spotted the budding actor and immediately noticed his good looks.

'I think he had his eye on me, because we were in the same lunch period or something,' she told Cosmopolitan in a new interview.

'[One day freshman year] I was with my friend, and he was walking down the block. I didn't even know he went to my school—I just thought he was really attractive.'

Luckily, a friend of Violetta's was there to tell her more about the mysterious stranger.

'Then he walked up to us and said, ""What's good?"" and [mimes a fist bump]. I thought he liked her!'

Although she was originally convinced Ansel was on his way to developing a crush on her friend, the actor's behavior made it clear he was in fact interested in getting to know Violetta better.

"Powerful Hollywood Women Unveil Anti-Harassment Action Plan
Driven by outrage and a resolve to correct a power imbalance that seemed intractable just months ago, 300 prominent actresses and female agents, writers, directors, producers and entertainment executives have formed an ambitious, sprawling initiative to fight systemic sexual harassment in Hollywood and in blue-collar workplaces nationwide.

The initiative includes:

— A legal defense fund, backed by $13 million in donations, to help less privileged women — like janitors, nurses and workers at farms, factories, restaurants and hotels — protect themselves from sexual misconduct and the fallout from reporting it.

— Legislation to penalize companies that tolerate persistent harassment, and to discourage the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence victims.

— A drive to reach gender parity at studios and talent agencies that has already begun making headway.

— And a request that women walking the red carpet at the Golden Globes speak out and raise awareness by wearing black.

Called Time’s Up, the movement was announced on Monday with an impassioned pledge of support to working-class women in an open letter signed by hundreds of women in show business, many of them A-listers. The letter also ran as a full-page ad in The New York Times, and in La Opinion, a Spanish-language newspaper.

“The struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard and acknowledged in male-dominated workplaces must end; time’s up on this impenetrable monopoly,” the letter says.","0"

Word of Lincoln’s retirement from the long-running series broke Tuesday, with ComicBook.com exclusively revealing AMC is expected to officially announce Lincoln’s exit ahead of his final episodes in season 9.

According to reports, AMC aims to bump Daryl Dixon star Norman Reedus up to leading man status with a $20 million payday while Lincoln and Maggie Rhee actress Lauren Cohan are “phased out” with just a handful of episodes in the upcoming season 9.

The Walking Dead season 8 saw the show drop to its lowest ratings since its first season in 2010, bringing in just a 2.9 rating in adults 18—49 and 6.8 million viewers in Nielsen Live+Same Day numbers with episode 8×10, ‘The Lost and the Plunderers.’

That episode followed the mid-season premiere, ‘Honor,’ which controversially killed off longtime survivor Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs).

With the upcoming exits of both Lincoln and Cohan — and the already significant losses of Riggs’ Carl and Lennie James’ Morgan, who made the leap to spinoff Fear The Walking Dead at the start of its fourth season — The Walking Dead risks losing even more viewership once two of its biggest stars are gone before the mid-season finale.

Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes) will be leaving The Walking Dead by the end of next season.



I knew I had every reason to want to stop watching it. They should have ended it this season when they had the chance… — Jon Z (@JonZarlengz) May 29, 2018

Serena Williams withdraws from Australian Open

Show Caption Hide Caption The best and worst of 2017 in sports SportsPulse: Handing out the year-end awards to the sports world. USA TODAY Sports

Serena Williams announced Thursday she won’t defend her Australian Open title.

The 23-time Grand Slam winner said on Snapchat she is “super close” to returning to her championship form five months after she gave birth to her first child.

Her post read in part:

“My coach and team always said ‘only go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the way’. I can compete – but I don’t want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time. With that being said, and even though I am disappointed about it, I’ve decided not to compete in the Australian Open this year.



“The memory of last year’s Open is one that I will carry with me, and Olympia and I look forward to coming back again. I appreciate the support and understanding of my fans and everyone at the Australian Open.”

The Australian Open begins Jan. 15. Williams’s victory last year was her seventh in Melbourne and her last Grand Slam victory before the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.

The Australian Open tweeted best wishes shortly after her announcement, saying in part: ""Good luck for the rest of 2018, Serena! We'll miss you""

Andy Murray pulled out of the event earlier Thursday, citing a hip injury. And Novak Djokovic, who has won in Melbourne six times, is undecided on whether he'll play.

"What to know before diving into Netflix's 'Casting JonBenet'
What to know before diving into Netflix's 'Casting JonBenet'

Show Caption Hide Caption Watch the trailer for 'Casting JonBenet' Netflix takes a unique look at the mysterious death of JonBenet Ramsay in 'Casting JonBenet,' available for streaming April 28. Netflix

Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the length of the documentary. It is one hour and twenty minutes.

Casting JonBenét is not your typical true crime documentary du jour. Rather, it serves as a contrast to the numerous programs devoted to the villainy that aired on CBS, Investigation Discovery, Lifetime and Dr. Phil last year.

Those yearning to resolve this two-decade-old crime need to check those lofty ambitions at the foot of the bed or armrest of the couch prior to devouring the one hour and 20-minute film to sidestep disappointment. The latest directorial exploit from Kitty Green (Ukraine Is Not a Brothel and The Face of Ukraine: Casting Oksana Baiul) does not provide puzzle pieces or insight as to why the lifeless body of JonBenét Ramsey was discovered in December of 1996.

Instead of focusing on friends of the six-year-old beauty queen's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, or investigators, the lens turns to local actors in the Boulder community to be featured in limited reenactments. Also, unlike its title suggests, auditions for the role of the blonde beauty are only a tiny fraction of the film.

Confused? Green's approach is certainly a unique way to look at the case. Over the course of 15 months, filmmakers met with the Coloradans and sought out their beliefs about the crime. The result is a documentary that conveys popular theories about the case as well as biases.

During their auditions, many reveal a tie to the incident. A voice teacher's students knew JonBenét. A hopeful vying for the part of Patsy revealed her parents met the Ramsey matriarch and patriarch ""several times,"" because her b","0"
"Kim Kardashian & Sisters Undergo Intense Media Training on KUWTK
It’s hard to believe, but one of America’s most famous families was never officially media-trained.

On Sunday’s midseason finale of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kim convinced her mom and sisters to meet with a communications coach so that they could each figure out how to answer the questions they tend to avoid during interviews — and no stone was left unturned.

Kourtney and Khloé Butt Heads

They document their workouts almost every day on Snapchat, but Kourtney, 38, and Khloé, 33, decided they wanted to produce something a little more professional for their fans: a full workout video. The idea quickly took on a life of its own, and somehow, the two agreed to start a fitness line together as well — forcing Khloé to put her already-in-the-works athleisure line with her clothing company, Good American, on hold.

But Kourtney struggled to commit fully to the massive responsibility of the project, and soon enough, her sister had had it.

“Kourtney and I are a nothing brand right now. We’re just not seeing eye-to-eye,” she said. “Sometimes I love having a partner, but when you’re just not in sync, it’s a little frustrating.”

Eventually, she realized she wasn’t going to get what she needed from Kourtney, who herself acknowledged that the two sisters have different priorities.

“I was hoping you and I could do something together, but it doesn’t really seem like this train is moving at the speed I want it to move,” said Khloé. “For now, I think it’s smart for me to move forward with Good American in doing this kind of stuff.”

“Go for it, girl,” said Kourtney, admitting that she’s not “the fastest-moving person” and tends to “procrastinate.”

“You’re like Nate Dogg — you’re only good for hooks,” quipped Khloé. “You can’t sell your own album.”

After undergoing her own media training, Kim realized how beneficial it was and asked her family to give it a shot.

"What Shonda Rhimes’ Move to Netflix Means for Broadcast TV
Shonda Rhimes’ decision to leave the fold at ABC Studios for Netflix is a blow to Disney, her TV home for the past 15 years, and a blow to broadcast TV in general.

Rhimes has been one of primetime’s most reliable hitmakers in the dozen years since her first-ever series, “Grey’s Anatomy,” became a force for ABC. By multiple accounts, the uber-showrunner is ready to move on to a new chapter of her career – one that gives her and her Shondaland factory far more room to maneuver from a creative perspective.

Broadcast TV is still the biggest platform in the traditional TV universe but it has become increasingly less attractive to creatives, especially those like Rhimes who have nothing left to prove in the network TV arena.

As development for the 2018-19 cranks into high gear, industry insiders are grousing about a general stasis when it comes to dealmaking and a lack of ambition in programming at a time when the array of material on competing outlets has never been more diverse. “So many remakes and reboots – why?” lamented one top agent.

Popular on Variety

On the flip side, many network executives privately say they feel like they’re under siege. Success for them is still defined by broad-based hits – think “This Is Us” – but smaller rivals are forking over significantly more money and perks (longer production schedules, shorter episode orders, flexibility in format and length) to draw high-wattage talent.

Executives point to changes in the traditional network playbook such as ABC granting Viola Davis’ wish to do 15 episodes a season of Shondaland’s “How to Get Away With Murder” rather than the standard 22. NBC last season similarly recognized showrunner Michael Schur’s desire to deliver 13 episodes per season of his offbeat comedy “The Good Place.”

From ABC’s perspective, it’s hard to watch Rhimes walk out the door – except that she’s still doing a lot of day-to-day business with them and will be for th","0"

"Grammys 2018: why people are wearing white roses to the ceremony
writes about pop culture, media, and ethics. Before joining Vox in 2016, they were a staff reporter at the Daily Dot. A 2019 fellow of the National Critics Institute, they’re considered an authority on fandom, the internet, and the culture wars.

The latest development in the push to express strength among women and solidarity in the wake of the #MeToo movement comes in the form of a classic symbol: a white rose.

White has long been associated with the fight for women’s equality, going back to the days of the suffragettes. Now attendees of the 2018 Grammy Awards are mobilizing to wear white roses to the ceremony as a way of recognizing the ongoing cultural reckoning with sexual harassment and abuse occurring across several industries, including entertainment.

Industry marketer Meg Harkins and promoter Karen Rait came up with the idea earlier this week, according to Billboard, at a dinner where they and other music industry insiders brainstormed ways to ensure that the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements were acknowledged at the Grammys, just like they were at the Golden Globes.

After they had chosen the white rose — which they settled on as a symbol of peace, hope, and resistance — they began to spread the word by way of a mass email from Atlantic Records chair Julie Greenwald. Celebrities who’ve confirmed they’ll be wearing white roses to the Grammys include Halsey, Kelly Clarkson, Cyndi Lauper, and Rita Ora, among others on a list that reportedly numbers in the hundreds.

When informed of the movement during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Grammys host James Corden immediately voiced support and said he’d be wearing one as well.

Harkins and Rait told Billboard they were working to coordinate their messaging with the leaders of the Time’s Up campaign, which has been generally viewed as a leveling-up of the #MeToo movement to call for action and change in Hollywood. Time’s Up also doubles as a","0"

Reed and Somerhalder revealed that while vacationing in Barcelona, Spain, in 2016, the actor went into his wife’s bag and threw out her birth control pills. “It was the beginning of the pack, so I had to pop all those suckers out,” Somerhalder said.

The couple laughed about the incident, going on to share that the decision to start a family was made together with their close friends so they could all hopefully raise their children together.

But some people felt that the couple’s comments were troubling, with one article accusing Somerhalder of trying to “force” Reed “into pregnancy.”

"Saudi Arabia to Behead 6 School Girls for Being With Their Male Friends Without Parents or a Guardian
Western countries are being urged to intervene in a case where 6 young school girls facing execution for acting indecently at a friends house.

Fathima Al Kwaini and her friends that included three male friends have celebrated

Kwaini's

birthday at a friends house. A neighbor supposedly an assistant of an Imam of a mosque close by has reported this to Saudi Arabia's religious police. When the police arrived the girls were dancing with their male friends and they were arrested immediately.









The ultra conservative Arabian nation that has one of the worst human rights records is also a member of the United Nations Human Rights commission and recently got elected to the Women's Rights Commission as well which sparked anger and protest.

According to HRW the girls were detained for more than a year before the trial and never confessed committing any crime. However the verdict of the ""male only"" Sharia panel was that they need o be executed in accordance with the Sharia law. The boys were only advised ""not to be victimized"" the report further states.

How does an 18-year-old girl fresh out of high school who has been caught smoking pot more than the Bush twins were caught drinking land a job as an intern at the US Embassy in Spain? Privilege. Obama and his pals liked to call it “white privilege,” but they really can’t in this case, can they? In this case the daughter of a president was moved to the front of the line.

It didn’t last long, however, because just like at home, Malia has issues with staying out of trouble. She was caught, by Embassy Security — aka the US Marines — on the roof of the building burning a doobie and playing with the Ambassador’s carrier pigeons. Ambassador Bedard is an avid hobbyist.

Malia was terminated immediately, her room was cleared and she was escorted from the private areas of the embassy to the common area where she could wait to change the dates on her travel visa so she could return home. She was last seen in the lobby when a black SUV pulled up out front and she willingly got in. Looks like Daddy probably saved the day again.

The King James Bible has been available for purchase at Target stores ever since the company was founded as Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902.

Speaking with CNBC, Cornell cited recent protests from what he calls “religious extremists” as the reason to pull the bible from its shelves. “Target will no longer cater to religious extremists,” said Cornell. “If that means removing the bible from our shelves, then so be it.” Cornell said the big box chain is “sticking to its guns” regarding their bathroom policy, and will be phasing out anything having to do with religion. “We believe that everyone, every team member, every guest, and every community, deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.”

"BREAKING: Hillary Clinton Has Third Heart Attack-Docs Says She ‘Won’t Survive’
Hillary Clinton had a third and most-likely fatal heart attack this afternoon after spending the morning being told she’d be getting better. It almost seems fitting that the last thing she hears is a lie about her own well-being.

The Butcher of Benghazi will meet her maker, says Doctor Eugene Icsa of Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York, as the damage to her heart is irreparable at this point:

“Secretary Clinton fought hard but today her fight is over. We predict she’ll be at rest within hours.”

The Clinton family has asked for privacy and wouldn’t answer questions about whether or not they had to decide to “pull the plug” or if they’re simply being told nothing can be done. Chelsea Clinton was seen entering the hospital in tears shortly after noon, according to a new report from LLOD correspondent Skip Tetheluda:

“Chelsea came alone and was obviously distraught. She made no comment to the press but did stop to tell one photographer to have some respect while she ‘visits a great woman for the last time.’ She hasn’t come out and is presumably sitting and waiting to say goodbye. Bill Clinton is sitting on the front porch of the Chappaqua mansion drinking what looks like either tomato juice or a Bloody Mary.”

The President made the comment during a courtesy call paid on him by Jamaica’s Ambassador to the United States, Her Excellency Audrey Marks, at the Oval Office in the White House.

During their discourse, Mr Trump and Ambassador Marks underscored the strong longstanding bond of friendship between the people Jamaica and the United States of America, while noting the island’s contribution in many spheres of American life.

Ms Marks said she looked forward to working with the President in the interest of both countries, and highlighted the synergies of the US-Caribbean nexus cementing the relationship between the nations.

The Ambassador, in noting the President’s agenda of providing more trading opportunities for US companies, called attention to the significant trade surplus the North American country enjoys in the Caribbean.

She highlighted the fact that the region is the United States’ seventh largest trading partner, importing non-oil goods and services valued over US$50 billion.

This, she said, placed the region ahead of U.S. exports to comparatively larger economies such as Russia and India combined.

Ms Marks further noted the mutual benefit and alignment of interest for the continued stability and economic growth of the Caribbean which she described as the United States’ ‘third border’.

"Black Men Arrested In Philadelphia Starbucks Settle For $2 Million
Instead of a long and drawn-out legal battle, the men at the center of the Philadelphia Starbucks arrest incident have taken an incredibly low settlement from the city with a perk that speaks to their interests. Taking $1 dollar settlements each, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will help spearhead a $200,000 grant program designed to aid young entrepreneurs like themselves.

NBC News reports:

The two black men whose arrest at a Philadelphia Starbucks last month set off a wave of protests against the coffee giant for discrimination have reached a settlement with the city, the mayor’s office said Wednesday.

They will each be paid $1.

In addition, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, both 23, will release the city and employees of all claims in exchange for the creation of a $200,000 fund that, through the help of a nonprofit organization, will assist young entrepreneurs in Philadelphia.

Robinson and Nelson will also serve on a committee to establish and award the grants, which will focus on starting a pilot curriculum for public high school students to attain the skills to become business owners.

Good for Nelson, Robinson, and the city of Philadelphia in turning this into a positive moment.

"ICE Detainer Issued for Suspected Wine Country Arsonist in Sonoma Jail
UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.

The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.

Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.

Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.

Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.

Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.

The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.

Horrifying video captured by a student shows lifeless victims as teens were rescued by police and ushered out of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.

In the aftermath, one traumatised survivor described how ""there was blood everywhere"" after bullets were fired through classroom windows as the gunman stalked the sprawling campus.

Teens posted disturbing photos and videos on social media, with one showing students hiding under desks and screaming as barrage of gunshots echo through the building.

The suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, was charged on Thursday with 17 counts of premeditated murder, with the victims including an assistant football coach who gave his life to protect students.

With only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate.

As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.

It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day.

So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.

Here is who has declined so far:

That sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: ""Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.""

After Trump made it clear that Obama had illegally tapped the phones at Trump Tower, the FBI issued a warrant for his arrest. Since then, little has been heard from the former president other than a denial.

This morning, Obama was stopped at a checkpoint at Toronto International Airport, where he was trying to fly to an unknown destination under the alias “Bruce Wilekenmeyer.” The CRMP officer who stopped him recognized him beneath a fake mustache, took him into custody and turned him over to the US Embassy.

After a short transport back to Washington, Obama was brought before a special session of US District Court where he could be formally charged and ordered not to leave the country before being released into his attorney’s custody.

Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.

"Rice told investigators why she unmasked Trump aides
Story highlights The crown prince arrived in New York before Trump was sworn into office The Obama administration felt misled by the United Arab Emirates

Washington CNN —

Former national security adviser Susan Rice privately told House investigators that she unmasked the identities of senior Trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York late last year, multiple sources told CNN.

The New York meeting preceded a separate effort by the UAE to facilitate a back-channel communication between Russia and the incoming Trump White House.

The crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, arrived in New York last December in the transition period before Trump was sworn into office for a meeting with several top Trump officials, including Michael Flynn, the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his top strategist Steve Bannon, sources said.

The Obama administration felt misled by the United Arab Emirates, which had failed to mention that Zayed was coming to the United States even though it’s customary for foreign dignitaries to notify the US government about their travels, according to several sources familiar with the matter. Rice, who served as then-President Obama’s national security adviser in his second term, told the House Intelligence Committee last week that she requested the names of the Americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally, a practice officials in both parties say is common.

Rice’s previously undisclosed revelation in a classified setting shines new light on a practice that had come under sharp criticism from the committee chairman, California Rep. Devin Nunes, and President Donald Trump, who previously accused Rice of committing a crime.

But her explanation appears to have satisfied some influential Republicans on the committee, undercutting both Nunes and Trump and raising new questions about whether any Trump associat","1"

OUT OF THIS WORLD Buzz Aldrin ‘passes UFO lie detector test leaving experts convinced that he encountered alien life’

LEGENDARY astronaut Buzz Aldrin passed a lie detector test over claims he's encountered alien life, reports claim.

Aldrin, the second man on the moon, and four others gave accounts of their sightings under strict lab conditions.

He, Al Worden, Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper all took part in the study conducted by the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology in Albany, Ohio.

Aldrin, 88, claimed he was a spaceship on his way to the moon, adding: ""There was something out there that was close enough to be observed... sort of L-shaped.""

The tests, reportedly more reliable than standard lie detector tests, showed he was telling the truth, the Daily Star reported.

Apollo 15 pilot Worden, 85, and Apollo 14's Mitchel also claimed to have seen UFOs while Cooper says he actually tried to chase a cluster of objects.

"Breaking: Greitens Accuser Admits Photo Session May Have Been A “Dream”
One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.

A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.

The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.

When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”

The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”

K.S. replied, “Correct.”

The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”

K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”

Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”

Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”

K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.

"Obama Administration Kept Illegal Mexican Kids In Detention Camps As “Experiment”
It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, “including thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.

It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.

His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettle","1"

"United Airlines Flight Attendant Slaps Crying Baby During Flight
During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.

The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”

After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.

The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.

The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements.","1"

"Man charged with murder after driving into anti-far-right protesters in Charlottesville
A man has been arrested and charged with murder after a car rammed into a group of people peacefully protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one person and injuring 19.

Police said a 32-year-old woman had died and that they were attempting to notify her family before releasing more details.

Col Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville regional jail, told the Guardian that 20-year-old James Fields, of Ohio, had been arrested following the attack on Saturday.

“He has been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death,” Kumer said in an email.

Donald Trump condemned the “violence on many sides”, but faced criticism for failing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators.

In a separate incident, two police officers died when their helicopter, which was monitoring the far-right rally, crashed outside Charlottesville.

State police said in a statement the helicopter was “assisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation” when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.

The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.

Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.

"Head Of NFL Fines Steeler Teammates $1 MILLION Each!


BREAKING: NFL Fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1m Each For Skipping National Anthem – YouTube

The hooey hit the fanbase. That is, when the NFL Black Lives Don’t Matter gang attacked patriotism and the US flag and most of the football fans, this blew up big time to the point, the frightened commissioner of this gang of thugs suddenly woke up and issued his first punishment for the people protesting at games: a million dollars each! I hope for two things: Villanueva is exempt plus since he was intimidated by both coach, the owner of the Steelers and fellow teammates, 50% of this fine should go to him! How about that?



Alejandro Villanueva apologizes for throwing Steeler teammates ‘under the bus’ – YouTube

Kim of North Korea is now running the NFL, it appears. The abject apology of this poor football player is backfiring very badly. People are twice as angry as before. Now, the hatred of the ‘other players’ who dissed the American flag is not gone away, either. They demanded everyone join them in being anti-patriotic and now this poor guy is doing exactly that. The NFL is now in dire straits. Like the DNC, they think they can impose their ideology on everyone else via force. Well, it isn’t working at all.

As I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that ‘team’ that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed. People are very angry at him for surrendering but then, he had everyone against him. Now, he should be rehabilitated, he needs a HUGE apology from the entire NFL leadership and his former teammates.

"Debbie Wasserman Schultz Aide Arrested Trying to Flee the Country
An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.

Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.

Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.

Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.

Awan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.

""Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,"" Damron said in a emailed statement.

Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.

The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a ""riskier"" forms of collateral, according to court documents.

However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.

The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.

"GOP Official Who Says America Needs “Another 9/11” Shares _______________ With Trump
The resistance against Trump must continue…these aren’t just small ideological differences being played out, or debates where both sides should be calmly and distantly considered. To the contrary, the very foundation and basis of the country we call our own is at stake! That is why this viral guide to getting involved with the opposition is so important…if you haven’t read it yet, you should absolutely do so now!

And things continue to look dire, and it goes even beyond Trump: GOP Rep Rob McCaskill (R-Texas) Twitter feed, much like the Orange one in the Oval Office, is a huge basket full of crazy. He tweets with glee about global warming “hoaxes.” He tweets that Americans should boycott Nordstrom for removing Ivanka’s merchandise (they were, that’s why they pulled the line).

The worst tweet from McCaskill, though, was one from Friday, where he very literally wished for another 9/11 just to prove judges wrong. That’s right, he tweeted “Can’t wait for the next 9/11 so the 9th District circuit ruling judges will wish they didn’t roll over for enemies wishing death on America #MuslimBan.”

Um, seem scary to you? With tweets saying the judges would be responsible for a terrorist attack, the administration is laying the groundwork for a deeper police state or for something we’ve never had in this country, martial law. Trump is a dictator. While McCaskill may not be smart enough to be in on the plan, he’s certainly complicit and he’s demonstrating what nearly all Republicans are guilty of. He doesn’t care about the American people. He only cares about his party.

This is terrifying, and there’s never been a more important time to stand up to fight and defend your country. If you are ready to join the opposition but aren’t quite sure how to get involved, take this grassroots call to action today!","1"
"82-Year-Old Who Killed A Muslim In Self-Defense Gets The Death Penalty
82-year-old William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, California, has been sentenced to death for defending himself against a life-threatening situation. In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.

The men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.

Now, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster — which is “illegal” in California — and put both men down in seconds.

Prosecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was “extreme and unnecessary.” The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:

“Mr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men’s initial wounds were superficial.

While they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn’t ‘denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull.

Hallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn’t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.”

"Donald Trump to issue an executive order to ban Facebook across US
Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.

_O_n the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook — an American corporation — being banned in the country.

_U_nfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. “Inside, we both know what’s been going on. We know the game and we’re gonna play it,” said Trump.

_G_overnance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news , a lot of false stories and ‘alternative facts’ were still being circulated on the site.

_O_ther social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.

_T_he people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.

_R_ick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President’s “commitment” should have not just been limited to Facebook. “You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of,” Rowlinson said. “You wouldn’t get this from any other guy,” he added, shaking his head.

Update: On Friday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officials who he alleges are involved in these hackings and leaks. You can read about the new breaking indictment at this link. Our original explainer on the hackings, written before the new indictment, is below.

Original post: There’s one positively enormous shoe that still hasn’t dropped in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaign: an indictment about all those hacked emails.

The hacking and release of leading political figures’ emails is the most visible election intervention attributed to Russia’s government. And it’s long been one of the leading, and perhaps the leading, possibility about just what “collusion” between Donald Trump’s team and the Russians might have involved.

That’s not mere speculation. We’ve gradually learned of not one but six times Trump associates at least tried to get involved with either Russian-provided dirt, hacked Democratic emails, or WikiLeaks. We don’t yet know whether these furtive contacts resulted in anything of significance — but one of these advisers, George Papadopoulos, has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the matter and has begun cooperating with Mueller’s team.

These hacks were crimes, victimizing many hundreds of Americans (those who had their documents stolen, and those who corresponded with them).

"Breaking: Mar-A-Lago Destroyed By Irma-Jared Kushner Still Missing
The building Jared Kushner was reportedly in is gone. .

Mar-A-Lago was at the front and center of a rogue wave created by the outer bands of Hurricane Irma. The wave, spanning hundreds of yards across and nearly 20-feet high crashed directly into the Palm Beach estate of President Trump.

Several other properties on either side, including the home of guitar legend Kieth Richards, were also destroyed. The staff at Mar-A-Lago had been sent home except for those who live on the property. They were all in the “safe” building towards the rear of the property when the wave hit.

The building, designed by Eric Trump, was supposed to be able to withstand bunker-busting bombs. He told the National Report that the reason the water was able to penetrate was simple physics:

“I designed the building for an air raid. Who would ever think that the threat would come from the side? Those walls were just normal walls to keep cost down. The roof was what was designed to absorb the impact. Mass equals force times accelarated ions.”

Eric Trump was a decorated mathematician at Oxford and scored well above genius on the Hershman-Rorytar Test. Clearly, the fault for Kushner’s probable fate lies with Kushner himself for not seeking proper shelter.","1"

Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents

Anonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.

The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.

This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.

However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.

It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.

It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.

"McCain Blamed For Sabotaging Trump
Senator John McCain should be supporting President Donald Trump and his Congressional peers in order to make America safe again but he obviously felt the need to go around the White House and call the Australian Ambassador to offer his “unwavering support.”, reports Angry Patriot.

McCain called the Australian ambassador, to pass on a message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that might be a violation of the Logan Act. The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries.

The Senator stated that Australia is one of America’s oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit, he called Australia’s Ambassador to the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.

According to the Logan Act, any citizen of the United States who “without permission of the United States” either directly or indirectly “commences or carries on correspondence” with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to “influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer” in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years– or both.

McCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.

Even if McCain is still the sitting Senator from Arizona, that does not exempt him from the dictates of the Logan Act.

"Whoopi Goldberg: Navy SEAL Widow was “Looking for Attention”
Whoopi Goldberg is in hot water after comments she made Wednesday regarding the Navy SEAL widow that was honored last night during President Donald Trump’s historical speech.

“She was just looking for attention. These military widows love their 15 minutes in the spotlight”, Goldberg said.

“If it were me I wouldn’t be able to leave the house. How can someone who is truly greiving go out there and be on TV. It just doesn’t make sense to me”

After last night’s demonstration where several democrats in leadership roles refused to stand while the widow was being honored, Goldberg continues to make the point that liberals lack a significant amount of class.

"Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month
Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.

Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.

Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.

In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.

The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.

A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.

“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in on","1"
"Obama Goes To G20 Summit
62.1k SHARES Share

Obama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.

Obama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obama’s administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move.

The liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administration’s problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that?

“The funny thing,” a White House official said, “is that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.”

“But I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel,” he went on, “no one in the press would say it was her staffs’ fault.”

That is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?

"Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not ‘Built by Immigrants’
Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was “built by immigrants.”

Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE

What is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not “immigrants” but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town’s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.","1"
"BREAKING: Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, raising questions over Mueller’s fate
WASHINGTON — Rod Jay Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice has been removed from his office.

Nearly everyone who knows him seems to agree that Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General and the official overseeing the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of links between the Trump campaign and Russia, has a reputation for integrity.

Rod who is described by Jim Trusty, the former head of the Justice Department’s organized-crime division as a prosecutor, not a persecutor, had sought earlier to protect his good image by not taking a hastened decision to fire anyone without justifiable reasons.

But Trump could not fire Mueller directly, according to the law that authorizes Mueller’s probe, so the only possible way is to throw the Justice Department into upheaval by firing Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein who only holds the key Mueller’s expulsion.

Only the person acting as attorney general, and Rod Rosenstein who was on matters related to the probe, could fire Mueller, and he said he won’t do it without “good cause.” So Trump would first had to purge the upper ranks of the Justice Department until he finds someone willing to follow his orders and dismiss the special counsel.

Conflicting reports claim Rosenstein had resigned but it’s understood that Donald Trump made the decision to remove him after a review from his chief of staff, John Kelly.

UNDER the best of circumstances—when America has a president who is disciplined, willing to hear harsh but necessary truths and loyal to those he trusts—the post of Attorney General is “perhaps one of the most powerful job in Washington”, according to Loretta Lynch.

"John Hagee Calls For “Prosecuting Women Who Say God’s Name During Intercourse”
“One of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord’s name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.”

“Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.

“Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.”

“Saying the Lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,” Hagee elaborated. “But, that’s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don’t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.”

The pastor reprimanded: “But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.”

Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: “Well, we","1"
"The Kardashians donate whopping sum to Las Vegas mass shooting victims
The Kardashian family has a net worth in the hundreds of millions, and they’re using their wealth to step up in a big way for those in need. The reality TV family banded together to raise $1 million to the families of victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting.

Earlier today, we announced that the Kardashian family will be donating $1 million to the victims of Las Vegas mass shooting, considering both the bereaved and the surviving victims.

Also, to benefit those impacted by the shooting, the Kardashian family will be hosting a “Day of Giving” on October 7. A “Day of Giving” will begin on Friday morning with other American celebrities and continue throughout the day on E!News. Across our social platforms, there will be a #DayofGiving call-to-action to donate to the victims of Las vegas shooting, with those dollars going to benefit those most impacted, the statement read.

“Our hearts go out to everyone in the devastating path of this historic mass shooting,” said Kim Kardashian. The most decorated family said it’s hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because people are still recovering from the historic tragedy. But we know several people have been bereaved or victimized and now face the daunting challenge of putting lives and communities back together fearsomely, and we’re using our unique resources and reach to help those in need.”-the family continued.

“Las Vegas we are praying for you,” Khloé Kardashian tweeted immediately after announcing the family’s donation.

More than 50 people were killed and more than 500 more injured in a terrifying massacre Sunday night. It’s being reported by outlets as the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States.

"Colorado Rockies Embrace Cannabis: A Game-Changer for Fans
In the wake of groundbreaking legislation in Colorado, the sporting world is poised at the threshold of a new era, seeking innovative avenues to integrate the state’s newly legalized cannabis into the fan experience. This forward-thinking approach is emblematic of a broader shift towards the acceptance and commercialization of cannabis within mainstream sectors, including the realm of major sports.

The Rockies’ Pioneering Initiative

Leading the charge in this unprecedented venture is Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies, who are reportedly setting the stage to incorporate cannabis-infused edibles into their game-day offerings. This initiative, marking a significant departure from traditional concession fare, underscores a willingness to adapt and cater to evolving consumer preferences and legal landscapes.

At the forefront of the Rockies’ innovative concession lineup stands a quintessential edible that has long been synonymous with cannabis cuisine: the pot brownie. This move, confirmed by insiders within the Rockies organization, signals not just a nod to the changing legalities but a bold embrace of the cultural and culinary potential that legal cannabis holds within the context of sports entertainment.

Strategic Integration and Fan Engagement

The decision to introduce marijuana-infused brownies at concession stands is more than a novelty; it represents a strategic foray into enhancing the fan experience, aligning with the broader trends of experiential engagement that major sports organizations are increasingly prioritizing. This initiative also reflects a nuanced understanding of the demographic shifts and changing societal attitudes towards cannabis.

The Rockies’ venture into cannabis-infused concessions navigates a complex web of legal, ethical, and logistical considerations. This pioneering approach is predicated on a rigorous adherence to state laws and regulations surrounding the sale and ","1"

Romney shared his opinion on Trump’s controversial tweets by sayin:

“I think you’ve got a president who has some very serious emotional problems.”

“I’m especially concerned about his constant tweets about North Korea. It’s already bad and he is adding fuel to the fire.”

Romney added, “You’ve got a president who has been accused, by many, many women of harassment, to say the least. This is a guy who was on a tape seen by everybody in America essentially bragging about his sexual assault of women.”

“Do I think under those considerations of Al Franken resigned, do I think the president should resign? I do. Do I think he will? I don’t. But, yes, I do think he should resign.”

Romney continued, “Let me take it a little step further. We have a president of the United States who acknowledged on a tape widely seen all over the country that he’s assaulted women, so I would hope maybe the president of the United States might pay attention of what’s going on and also think about resigning. But if your point is it is not just Al Franken you are absolutely right.”

Not long ago Mitt Romney also stated that President Trump is “trying to divide us up by the color of our skin.”","1"

"HOLLYWOOD CELEBS: WE WILL GO ON ‘TOTAL STRIKE’ IF TRUMP DOES NOT RESIGN
Many of Hollywood’s elite are threatening to go on strike in protest of our President.

This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States, but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them, DO IT. We don’t need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie O’Donnell think that the movie and television industry wouldn’t survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are.

Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike, warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work.

“The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets, who make the costumes, who create the props, and in some cases, do the stunts and the special effects,”Mike explained. “And they’re not getting the bazillion dollar deals.”

It’s about time that these jerkoffs realize that they aren’t the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President, whether they like it or not, and that isn’t about to change.

Let’s hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didn’t win. Maybe if they took their heads out of their asses long enough to even listen to Trump’s goals for his time in office they would feel different

"White House Chef Quits Because Trump Has Only Eaten Fast Food For 6 Months
Photo by Shardar Tarikul Islam on Unsplash



Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.

Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.

“It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”

Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.

“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”

Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.

“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with","1"
"112-Year-Old Voters in North Carolina?
Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.

Have this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.

The true explanation is much less exciting.

Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old.","1"

“Mrs. Pelosi’s arrest order comes directly from the Oval Office,” said Special Agent Matthew Derpmore, “She’s wanted for questioning in a possible coup attempt against the president. That’s all we’re authorized to say at this time.”

"3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes


Waukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing people in the area in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning.

Canadian tourist, John O’Keef and his friend from Chicago, Allan Brooks captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake.

“We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before my friend Allan finally shot it with a rifle and wounded it to the head” explains O’Keef.

“I’d heard of the Lake Michigan monster, but never did I expect to catch it myself,” claims the 63-year-old Canadian tourist.

The great white shark estimated at more than 1.2 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts.

Professor of biology at the University of Illinois, Allan Jameson said: “This is not common to find such a beast so far inland. Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.

According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.

U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.

In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.","1"

"Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby
De Soto, Missouri – Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.

According to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family’s living room.

Moments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.

The 16-year-old babysitter named ‘Anna Ritchie’, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.

“I just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,” she told Officer Robert. “All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out” recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.

The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield’s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.

“Apparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,” explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. “Teeth marks were found on the baby’s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed” he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.

The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.","1"

She was run off the road in what authorities are calling a hit and run and nearly killed. The SUV she was driving rolled over several times and ended up in a drainage ditch.

Governor Palin was taken to a local hospital under an alias in case the hit and run were on purpose and not a random act of reckless driving. According to her spokesman, she is currently in a coma with 2 broken vertebrae and a broken thigh.

The Palin family has been notified and are currently making their way to her bedside. The FBI has been dispatched to the scene to collect evidence. The vehicle that ran her off the road was caught on a traffic camera and is being hunted by every law enforcement agency in the northwest.

""Congratulations! You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Delta Airline Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!"" states the website Delta-Flying.info.

After we started our fact-check, the link was no longer in use and had been flagged as suspected phishing. It is not an official Delta website.

Such hoaxes that Delta or other airlines, including Southwest Airlines, have been giving away free tickets have circulated for years.

Don’t take the surveys — these are all scams.

Graham Cluley, a security analyst, has previously written about the repercussions of the Southwest scam in 2016:

""The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions – whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. .... If you are ever in any doubt as to whether a special offer on Facebook is genuine or not, visit the company’s real website to see if they mention the competition there – or whether they are warning of a scam.""

Delta spokeswoman Kate Modolo pointed to this page on Delta.com where legitimate offers from the airline are located.

The story that said Delta Airlines offers free airline tickets for people who take a short survey is a scam. We rate this story Pants on Fire.","1"

"Bumble Bee Foods charged after man cooked with tuna
Bumble Bee Foods charged after man cooked with tuna

Bumble Bee Foods and two managers were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors Monday with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna.

Jose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on.

When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.

The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.

The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.

Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Prosecutions of workplace violations are uncommon — even in fatalities.

San Diego-based Bumble Bee said in a statement that ""we remain devastated by the loss of our colleague Jose Melena in the tragic accident."" It said it disagreed with the charges filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and that it was ""exploring all options with re","1"
"Stephen Bannon: “Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love”
The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.

“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.

Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”

But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know","1"
"A fake photo of Emma González went viral on the far right, where Parkland teens are villains
Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday. Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.

González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.

Marjory Stoneman Douglas senior and survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting delivered the final speech at Washington's March for Our Lives on March 24. (Video: The Washington Post)

Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.

Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.

A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.

The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.

The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.

He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march so","1"

"Haiti Official Getting Ready To Testify Against Clinton Foundation Corruption NEXT WEEK, Found DEAD With “Gunshot to the head”
It’s absolutely clear that the Clinton Foundation has faced some honest reports of stealing from impoverished Haitians devastated in the 2008 Hurricane Hanna, and straight through their own foundation. For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery. The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a “gunshot to the head” that’s been ruled a “suicide” by the Miami-Dade’s medical examiner records supervisor.

Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.

Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.

Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation’s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government’s economic development agency, Fonds d’assistance économique et social, for three years. According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The rem","1"

Earlier today Josh Caplan at The Gateway Pundit posted on Gloria Allred’s last ditch effort to swing the Alabama senate race to Democrat Doug Moore.

WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO)

Allred dragged out discredited Moore accuser Beverly Nelson to Good Morning America to hit Judge Roy Moore one last time before Tuesday’s vote.

Nelson admitted on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Friday that she tampered with and added “notes” to what she claims is Moore’s signature inside her yearbook.

The story is solid. The statements were made by Beverly Nelson this morning. The yearbook signature has been discredited as reported by ABC’s GMA this morning.

But after we posted the story this morning Facebook shut down our story.

"Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression
Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.

According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.

Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.

Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.

When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.

After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.

The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.

According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.

"Thinking about writing in a candidate on Election Day? Read this before you do.
Getting ballot access can be hard for smaller campaigns with fewer resources. Darrell Castle, the candidate for the Constitution Party, is on the ballot in more than two dozen states. Castle said his campaign has faced ballot access obstacles in California, Texas and Oklahoma. “Those states are virtually impossible for a party like mine because they cost so much money,” Castle said.

Castle isn’t on the ballot in Oklahoma. To be on the ballot there required signatures from at least 3 percent of all votes cast in the state in 2012, or about 40,000 signatures. Castle says this would likely require hiring professionals who often charge a few dollars for each signature.

"Trump Gives Chaffetz The Thumbs Up For Investigating Hillary Clinton’s Email Server
President Donald Trump has finally given Congress the authorization to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton.

Jason Chaffetz, the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, informed the committee that he had a meeting with President Trump who gave him permission to investigate whatever he wants. Chaffetz also hinted that charges against Hillary could be happening soon.

Here is what Chaffetz said:

“President Trump visited Philadelphia when we were at our planning and strategy session. I went backstage with the President. Here’s what he said: ‘You do a great job. Listen, I understand I’m the president and you have a job. You do the oversight. Don’t slow down. Go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at.’ If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight and government, you would be inspired. And for him to convey a message of ‘don’t slow down,’ I think was a good message.”

WATCH:

The news that President Trump supports the investigation comes just days after the Oversight Committee ordered James Comey, (now former) FBI Director, to release the contents of Hillary Clinton’s email server. This means that the lawless and reckless behavior of Hillary Clinton hasn’t yet escaped from a full-blown investigation.

Without Obama and Comey to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted. It’s about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country. She has to answer for that, and now that President Trump is in control, she won’t make it out of this investigation so easily.

According to our exclusive sources, Comey and Wasserman Schultz met while both working for the government, and despite the fact that both of them are married, they couldn’t put aside their lust for each other and decided to have an affair.

"10 Things You Didn't Know About Nancy Pelosi
Jim Lo Scalzo for USN&WR

1. One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.

2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.

3. Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth—as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.

4. A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.

5. Pelosi is mother to five—Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years—and grandmother to five.

6. Although active in politics her whole life—including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California—Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.

7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a ""new Democrat"" nor an ""old Democrat"" but a ""prehistoric Democrat."" Other Republicans call her a ""latte Democrat"" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.

8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat–around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.

"Texas church shooter was a militant atheist
Texas church shooter Devin Kelley was a “creepy” atheist “outcast” who never fit in and berated religious believers on social media, according to former friends and classmates.

“He was always talking about how people who believe in God we’re stupid and trying to preach his atheism,” wrote former classmate Nina Rose Nava in a Facebook post, according to the Daily Mail. “I legit just deleted him off my fb cause I couldn’t stand his post.”

“I removed him off FB for those same reasons!” replied Christopher Leo Longoria. “He was being super nagtive [sic] all the timd [sic].”

Oddly, Kelley lists teaching vacation Bible school as volunteer experience on his LinkedIn page, and his wife, Danielle Shields, was previously a teacher at a Baptist church, according to the Mail.

"BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan ‘You’re Fired’
Paul Ryan may be the Speaker of the House and he may be third in the line of succession for the presidency, but he will no longer be welcome at the White House nor will he be included in plans for the future. According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:

President Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.

Ryan’s office has asserted that he can not be “fired” by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:

Speaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump’s statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.

Relate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesn’t say things he doesn’t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.

This isn’t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Still reeling from Trump's previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn't yet another crony of something called ""The Constitution,"" Senate Democrats announced Friday.

""Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate address. ""And it's always - always - the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don't think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it's time for that to end.""

Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn't going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law.

"BOOM: Roy Moore Takes The Military Vote, Pulls Ahead By 5K Votes
The Alabama Secretary of State’s Division Of Electoral Balloting Integrity has begun sending emails to media outlets regarding the military vote count in the Roy Moore vs. Doug Jones Senatorial race. RWR obtained a copy of the email sent to Breitbart, confirming that Roy Moore is in the lead:

Dear Ferdinand, In response to your question on the final count of provisional military ballots, the Secretary has instructed the Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity to inform you that with 97 percent of that vote counted, Justice Roy Moore now leads the race by 5014 votes. Please feel free to inquire about the final 3 percent, which is fewer than 400 votes and can’t possibly change the outcome at this point. Warmest regards, Bethany Marie Palmaranian

What that means for the Jones campaign is that it will now be on them to ask for a recount and since the margin is more than .01573, he’ll have to pay for it himself. That could be a costly effort, estimated at nearly $213 million.

The Secretary of State’s office has already announced that the election won’t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he’ll waste the taxpayers’ time and money with a fruitless recount.

"Bill Murray Had This to Say About Rochester, New Hampshire Residents – News Daily 12
ROCHESTER, New Hampshire – During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Bill Murray took a moment to praise Rochester, New Hampshire residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:

“We were just leaving the city limits of Rochester, New Hampshire when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out. I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.

So then the one guy finds out that I’m not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I’m thinking, “Sure, what the hell.” So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rochester – some place called Wild Willy’s – and get a burger. Great freakin’ burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.

I’m telling you, these people in Rochester are the real deal. I’m gonna move there after I retire, ” Murray said with a laugh.

Murray added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would’ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that’s my story about Rochester. It’s nice to know there are still places like this in America.”

"TRUMP WANTS TO DEPORT AMERICAN INDIANS TO INDIA
Washington (dpo) – As part of his plan to improve national security and combat illegal immigration, US President Donald Trump intends to send around 3 million American Indians back to where they came from – India. He is to sign an executive order to this effect this week.

In an interview with Fox News, President Trump described Indians living in the USA as lawless warriors with a history of attacking and killing US citizens. He claimed, “I’ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can’t trust these Indians.”

President Trump consulted with the appropriate members of the government and found that most Indians do not possess the relevant immigration documents. “That means they are here illegally. I had to act.”

"Peter Strzok, FBI Agent in Texting Scandal, Will Testify Before Congress
Representative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena. Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”

The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”

Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” th","1"
"Mueller Will Be Forced To Resign Over Pelosi Affair
Robert Mueller’s steamy, 13-year affair with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is going to cost him more than a little bit of embarrassment and his marriage, according to a trusted source inside the Department of Justice. Mueller will also be forced to resign from his position as Special Prosecutor for the FBI, nullifying everything that investigator has uncovered as fruit of the poisonous tree.

Pelosi, who says her husband was well-aware of the affair, swears that Mueller was just a friend whose company she enjoyed on long, lonely working nights and weekends in Washington. The California “progressive” says her husband was afforded the same freedom to explore “pleasures of the flesh.” :

“We’re not interested in defending our actions or our values as human beings. I’m a public servant who will continue to serve until my health or my constituents say otherwise.”

Regardless of how much we hate Nacy Pelosi, she represents a Congressional District that saw a million fraudulent votes from illegal immigrants. She’ll hold that seat until she dies.

Mueller, on the other hand, is looking at a messy divorce, a public humiliation and the loss of his job. He’ll also go down in history as the man who had solid evidence against several Trump surrogates and allowed their cases to all be dismissed on a technicality. None of it would have led to Trump, but it still lifts a huge weight from his legacy.

Mueller is finished and will resign as early as next Tuesday at 4.

"Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Moved to Death Row in Terre Haute Federal Prison
Convicted church shooter Dylann Roof has been transferred to death row at Terre Haute Federal Prison in Indiana — the facility that houses male inmates awaiting execution under the federal government.

Roof, the first person to be convicted of a federal hate crime and sentenced to the death penalty, was removed from custody in Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday and transferred to Terre Haute, prison records show.

Terre Haute, a medium-security prison where inmates are put to death by lethal injection, currently houses 1,338 inmates.

In January, a jury sentenced the self-proclaimed white supremacist to death for killing nine black worshipers in June 2015 at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston during a Bible study. The 23-year-old told FBI agents that he was trying to start a race war.

He also pleaded guilty to nine counts of state murder charges on April 10.

Roof is now among the long list of well-known criminals who have spent time in the Indiana facility. Others include murderer and drug trafficker Raul Garza and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

As of Feb. 9, there were 62 federal inmates on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Three inmates have been on death row since 1993 — drug gang members Richard Tipton, James Roane Jr. and Corey Johnson, who were convicted of killing nine people to protect their crack trade.

"Facebook removes, censors Declaration of Independence as ‘hate speech’
It’s not surprising. The left hates our freedoms, and so designating the Declaration of Independence, the most magnificent document in all of human history, as hate speech is in line with their agenda.

"BREAKING: US comedian Kevin Hart in critical condition after gory car crash
Comedian Kevin Hart in critical condition after a single-car accident in Summerlin, Las Vegas Monday morning.

According to the police, Hart lost control of his car and went off the east side of the road and his car crashed head-on into a guardrail while he was driving at a high speed.

Metro Police said 38-year-old US comedian and film star Kevin Hart, was driving faster than the 25 mph speed limit while going north on Spring Gate Lane about 8:20 a.m today.

The undisputed king of comedy, as at the time of filing this report, remained in critical condition at MountainView Hospital in Summerlin, police can confirm.

Drugs and alcohol were not factors in the crash, police said.

A day before this tragic incident, comedian Kevin Hart posted a candid social media message confessing that he made a “bad error in judgement” which recently led to an undisclosed individual making an extortion attempt against him.

In an Instagram video, Hart said that, though he had never claimed to be perfect, he had recently put himself “in an environment where only bad things would happen”.

“I’m not perfect, I’m not gonna sit up here and claim that I am in any shape or form, and I made a bad error in judgement,” he told his followers. “In doing that, I know I’m going to hurt the people closest to me, who I’ve talked to and apologised to, them being my wife and my kids, and you know; it’s a shitty moment.”

Hart then explained that he had chosen to “‘fess up” rather than have someone attempt to make “financial gain from [his] mistakes. In this particular situation, that’s was what was attempted.”","1"

"Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Hillary’ Best Way To ‘Restore Public Faith In Govt’
302 SHARES Share Tweet

The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”

“Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.

Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!”

After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“

“The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.”

The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.

In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

"Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory: ‘This Is All About Income’
TBILISI, Georgia — Jobless and with graduation looming, a computer science student at the premier university in the nation of Georgia decided early this year that money could be made from America’s voracious appetite for passionately partisan political news. He set up a website, posted gushing stories about Hillary Clinton and waited for ad sales to soar.

“I don’t know why, but it did not work,” said the student, Beqa Latsabidze, 22, who was savvy enough to change course when he realized what did drive traffic: laudatory stories about Donald J. Trump that mixed real — and completely fake — news in a stew of anti-Clinton fervor.

More than 6,000 miles away in Vancouver, a Canadian who runs a satirical website, John Egan, had made a similar observation. Mr. Egan’s site, The Burrard Street Journal, offers sendups of the news, not fake news, and he is not trying to fool anyone. But he, too, discovered that writing about Mr. Trump was a “gold mine.” His traffic soared and his work, notably a story that President Obama would move to Canada if Mr. Trump won, was plundered by Mr. Latsabidze and other internet entrepreneurs for their own websites.

“It’s all Trump,” Mr. Egan said by telephone. “People go nuts for it.”

With Mr. Obama now warning of the corrosive threat from fake political news circulated on Facebook and other social media, the pressing question is who produces these stories, and how does this overheated, often fabricated news ecosystem work?","1"
"First Indictment Issued In Russian Bribery Case Tied To Obama-Era Uranium One Deal
While we were busy chasing the “S***hole” not-so-shiny object the press laid out for us on Friday, it is now discovered what the media was trying to distract us from! And it is HUGE!

The DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One Deal released on Friday. THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover-up. Unlike the leak with Manafort and his indictment (which had nothing to do with Russian collusion in the Trump campaign), America woke up to non-stop news about Manafort turning himself in. Click HERE to read more about that. Manafort has since sued Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Fast forward to today. Uranium One Deal has its FIRST INDICTMENT against Mark Lambert.

Mark Lambert of Maryland has been indicted for “allegedly paid bribes to a Russian Official so his Company could win highly sensitive nuclear fuel transportation contracts.”

The “11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.” This is serious. And it stems from Russian collusion in the Obama-era.

“The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.”

KUDOS to the Trump-era DOJ American’s can trust.

The hard working and honest DOJ team, under Jeff Sessions, made the announcement yesterday.

"Trump’s Top Scientist Pick: “Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer”
The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the “chief scientist” is supposed to be the leader “among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.” President Donald Trump’s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn’t seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.

When asked to comment on his credentials in a recent interview with KYXL Radio, Clovis, who is currently working as the senior White House advisor within the USDA, argued that he was “proud” he didn’t have any scientific credentials or education, because “scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead individuals anyway.” Asked to elaborate, he said that he was “glad” to be working in the Trump administration, but that he was, at the same time, “disappointed” as to where he was assigned. “While I can certainly appreciate President Trump’s reasons for placing me at my current position, at the same time I can’t help but feel as though my abilities are being severely misused here,” he said. “I do not agree with anything these people are trying to do. I mostly spend my days watching them run around in circles, trying to change the world or something. In reality, they’re just wasting their time.”

“When I get back home from work – believe me – I thank God every single day that he had the mercy not to make me a scientist as well,” Clovis continued. “I’m proud I’m not one of th","1"

"BREAKING: Trump Just Gave Every WORKING, LEGAL Man Woman And Child In The USA $612 EACH! -
If you’re not a lazy bum on welfare or an illegal here to steal food stamps and free medicine, President Trump has some good news for you. You, your wife and your children will all be receiving a stimulus bonus of $612 each to spend however you see fit inside the United States.

The program, called “Tax Relief For Deserving Americans,” will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead. The White House Communication and Propaganda Office released a statement about the program and how it will impact the economy:

While deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being “reported” by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of hoiw much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Mr. trump has decided people would rather focus ion spending some money than the nonsense on the “news,” and has therefore authorized the release of $612 each for every legal American from a working family.

Democrats are already crying because the people who will receive their chunk of the $153 billion program don’t necessarily need the money that could be spent buying them votes from deadbeats who like free stuff. They also don’t understand how the program will be paid for. Trump had a simple answer:

“It’s not that much money in the grand scheme. We’ll make Mexico pay for it with a new tax or maybe we’ll add a few bucks tariff to every case of Canadian Whiskey. Maybe the Chinese can help out. It’s be taxable income, so 28 percent of it will come back anyway. It’s not that big a deal. I’ve built things, great things, huge things worth far more.”

Democrats about lost their minds when they heard that President Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio this morning. Arpaio, convicted of a bogus charge for doing the job the people of Maricopa County elected him to do, was about to spend the next 12 to 18 months in a federal minimum security prison.

His second pardon of the day, while not as immediately necessary, held just as much meaning. By granting clemency to Kim Davis, the Kentucky County Clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, her record will be expunged and her good name reinstated. Davis has been seeing a probation officer monthly since the incident nearly two years ago now to prove she’s in compliance with the judge’s orders.

With her record cleared, she no longer has to check in with anyone or list herself on job, volunteer and credit applications as a criminal. A criminal is the farthest thing from what she is. She’s a conscientious freedom fighter who wouldn’t stand by while her rights were trampled and her very existence threatened.

She’s the perfect candidate for a Trump pardon, and that’s exactly what she got. Davis is expected to return to her job in the Clerk’s office where she can now refuse to issue marriage licences to gays and not worry about it becoming a “national scandal.” Davis said, “I told them all along I didn’t care if they went to the county down the street. Just not in my building. Not while my God still relies on me to do the right thing.”

"Last in Queen Elizabeth II’s line of corgis dies, says British press
London CNN —

Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II has lost the last descendant of her original corgi after 14-year-old Willow was put down at Windsor Castle on Sunday following a battle with cancer, according to UK media reports.

Willow was the last in a long line of royal corgis owned by Britain’s longest-serving monarch, reported British newspaper the Daily Mail.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the dog’s death, telling CNN it was a private matter.

The Queen’s fondness for corgis is well known, with Willow and the monarch even appearing beside James Bond actor Daniel Craig for a sketch shown during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.

Queen Elizabeth II has reportedly owned more than 30 corgis during her reign. PA Wire/AP

While the Queen still reportedly owns several other dogs, Willow was the only remaining descendant of Susan, the original corgi given to then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.

She received Susan as a gift after becoming attached to her father King George VI’s corgi called Dookie, the Daily Mail reported.

Since then, she has owned dozens of the breed, known for its distinctive short legs and standing-up ears.

Such was Queen Elilzabeth’s attachment to Susan, she reportedly took the dog on honeymoon with Prince Philip in 1947.

WITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY, MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS.

Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.

In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.

Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:

“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”

“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”

Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.



The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:

“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”

"Georgia Mosque KEEPS Hurricane Harvey Donations, Will Send To Syrian Refugees Instead
A mosque in Georgia is under fire after they solicited donations allegedly for victims of Hurricane Harvey but decided to keep them and send them to a different kind of refugee instead.

“Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter,” said Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton. “Allah has told us that we must consider where the need is greater and respond to it.”

The mosque recently made headlines for its “Good work” in the community. According to news reports at the time, the mosque had raised more than $340,000 in cash and supplies “for the victims of Hurricane Harvey.” All of that will now be sent overseas to Syria to “help” people in refugee camps, which have been repeatedly identified as breeding grounds for ISIS recruitment.

“We intended to send it to the people impacted by the hurricane,” Alkalb said when asked if he lied about his intent when asking for donations from the community. “But after much prayer, Allah told us that we must help the people who need it most.”

Residents are outraged, demanding that Alkalb return their donations but he says he will not be doing that.

"Scott Baio, Beloved Face Of Conservatism, Dies In Small Plane Crash On His Way To Visit Trump
Chachi can now apologize to Joannie for being so rude. Scott Baio, 56, was killed when the single-engine Cessna he was in crashed into the side of a hill in Louisiana. Baio was headed to Mar-A-Lago to barbecue shrimp and play gold with President Trump.

Baio’s wife, Raylene, wasn’t on the plane but was checked into St Timothy’s on a suicide watch after the news sent her into a breakdown. Spokesmen for several actors who wouldn’t be caught dead in a film with Baio said that he was “really special as Chachi” and he “sure did do a nice job with Charles in Charge.”

Baio, wildly successful as an actor since the ripe age of 13, says he saved every dime he ever made so he could live the lavish lifestyle of jetting across the country to golf with famous and powerful people. Unfortunately, that ended with a net worth of about $3.5 million and a whole lot of that was tied up in that nice house of his, so Baio was forced to go Cessna instead, which only would have gotten him there slightly faster than that new Kia Sorento he’s been sporting.

Baio will be missed by many. His ability to retweet things in support of our glorious president without even bothering to care what they were truly drove the social media movement to get Trump elected. When he heard the news that Baio was killed, Trump asked for a moment of silence in the dining room during his morning coffee and strudel. He hasn’t personally responded but Jeff Derpinger of the WHOIP told Freedom Crossroads correspondent Louis Leweigh:

“The President was saddened by the news once we reminded him that Scott was once ‘Chachi.’ He said he wished he knew the kid was coming; he would have sent the jet.”

“During the course of the last several weeks, I have met with the relevant senior career Department officials to discuss whether I should recuse myself from any matters arising from the campaigns for President of the United States.

“Having concluded those meetings today, I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.

"Trump warns Russia over Jehovah’s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the US
President Donald Trump has sent a strong message to the Russia Federation over the country’s ban on the “peaceful activities” of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Trump warns Russia to reverse its decision immediately else he would use the country’s own constitution against them.

“You know right that this is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russia Federation. I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you” – Trump warned.

Trump went on to invite all Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia to seek asylum in the United States until their religious rights are reinstated in Russia.

“As this is an infringement of your fundamental human rights, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated.” – Trump urged.

Russia’s Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovah’s Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russia’s obligations to respect and protect religious freedom.

The case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled a previous attempted ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia unlawful in 2010.

The Supreme Court was deciding on a claim lodged by the Russian ministry of justice to liquidate the group’s administrative centre near St Petersburg and 395 local organizations. Its decision will come into effect within 30 days unless an appeal is lodged, when it will be delayed until the resolution of the case.

“The Supreme Court has ruled to sustain the claim of Russia’s ministry of justice and deem the ‘Administrative Centre of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia’ organization extremist, eliminate it and ban its activity in Russia,” said judge Yuri Ivanenko. “The property of","1"
"Democrats go full TYRANNY: Now demand nationwide gun confiscation from law-abiding Americans… at gunpoint, of course
by: Ethan Huff

NaturalNews.com

Monday, May 07, 2018

A California Democrat was recently given a platform by USA Today to publish a shocking editorial that calls for nationwide confiscation of all “military-style semiautomatic assault weapons” from law-abiding citizens.

Representative Eric Swalwell from California’s 15th District wrote that all so-called “assault” weapons need to be banned, and that a federal gun buy-back program needs to be instituted in order to effectively collect them all from the citizenry.

Rep. Swalwell even goes a step further, insisting that those who refuse to hand over their “assault” weapons be criminally prosecuted – including law-abiding gun owners who have never been convicted of committing a crime with their legally-purchased weaponry.

Not content to simply impose a fresh ban on all new “assault” weapon purchases, which in and of itself is unconstitutional, Rep. Swalwell actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary.

“Reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would not affect weapons already possessed,” Rep. Swalwell wrote in his op-ed for USA Today. “This would leave millions of assault weapons in our communities for decades to come.”

“Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons.”

Democrats like Rep. Swalwell are enemies of the Constitution, and enemies of We the People

"Obama Orders Life-Sized Bronze Statute of Himself To Be Permanently Installed in White House
0

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Obama has ordered a $200,000, life-sized, bronze statue of himself, with plans to install it in the entryway of the White House. The president says that his legacy “should not be diminished,” and that this is the only way he can “keep an eye” over Trump, as well as future presidents.

“I have been president for only eight years, and in that time, I have done what no other presidents could do in all their time in total,” said Obama. “I have created a legacy that should not be diminished. I have created something that no future president will be able to do. In that regard, I have commissioned this statute, with plans to have it permanently erected in the entryway of the White House, so that all who enter can remember me fondly.”

The statue will not be allowed to be removed, as every president is allowed to leave one thing in the White House that must never be touched by future presidents. William Howard Taft left his giant bathtub. Bill Clinton left one of his saxophones. George W. Bush left a piece of mirror and a rolled up hundred.

"Libtard Hero Al Franken Forced To Resign In Disgrace
Libtard Democrat Al Franken will resign his seat as US Senator and Minority Leader this morning after learning that the White House has enough on him to ruin his marriage and send him to jail. Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Franken will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy.

This was a great move by Trump. Not only does he get rid of a huge political opponent, he shows America that our elected officials can be compromised and forced to do as they’re told. No more of this pussyfooting around with majority votes and filibusters…either get in line of get out.

One of these days the Democrats will realize they can’t keep up with the winning strategy of the Republican party. It doesn’t matter how many more votes the Dems get, the GOP continues to grow stronger. With Schumer out of the way it will grow even stronger. The alleged file on Franken includes things like pushing entitlement programs that are meant to give away free stuff for votes and adultery.

President Trump doesn’t mess around.

Fox News' Shepard Smith: 'Why is it lie after lie after lie?' on Russia meeting

Fox News host Shepard Smith slammed what he called ""lies"" and ""deception"" pushed by Donald Trump Jr. in a fiery Friday rant over emerging details of Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer last summer.

On Friday's Shepard Smith Reporting, the host launched into a tirade over Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing even as new details showed it included eight people. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians during the presidential campaign.

""We're still not clean on this, Chris,"" Smith told fellow Fox anchor Chris Wallace. ""Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean.""

Smith, who has chided President Trump for his treatment of the media, continued.

""The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling,"" he said. ""And there are still people out there who believe we're making it up and one day they're going to realize we're not.""

The diatribe left Wallace speechless.

""I don't know what to say,"" he said. ""I think there's a lot of truth to everything you've said.""

Smith's statements quickly spread across the Internet, where some called for his firing.

Smith went on the offensive against Trump and his administration earlier this year. In February, Smith defended CNN as ""not fake news,"" an accusation often lobbed by the president and his supporters.

"Man Loses His Testicles After Attempting To Smoke Weed Through A Scuba Tank
Drinking and drugging will teach you lots of lessons, one of which includes not smoking weed through a scuba tank after drinking copious amounts of alcohol.

Related: Colorado Trail Closed After Tourists Refuse to Stop Taking #bearselfies

In a recent report by the Boston Leader, 27 year-old Michael Fitzpatrick lost his testicles after trying to create a home-made smoking device out of an old scuba tank. The process included using an air compressor to put pot smoke into the tank before using a regulator to inhale.

According to multiple reports, Fitzpatrick invited his buddies over to check out the ‘Scuba Bong,’ a name that is both inaccurate and sounds much too much like ‘Scuba Bomb,’ when the accident occurred. While attempting to attach the air compressor to the tank, the victim knocked over the tank causing an explosion that would send shrapnel into his groin, severing his balls clean off.

None of his friends were injured in the accident.

The tank in question was fashioned in the early 90’s with a type of aluminum that is known for its capacity to rupture. However, the company that built the tank is unlikely to cover an insurance claim due to the victim’s use of the tank as a smoking device. Fitzgerald is still in the hospital and his condition has been downgraded from ‘critical’ to ‘serious.’

"“Gay People Should Wear Specially-Colored Clothes To Warn Straight People”
Televangelist Pat Robertson recently repeated his prediction that LGBT rights will provoke God to destroy America's financial markets, warning ""The 700 Club"" viewers that God's wrath is on its way. He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has ""enshrined sodomy into the United States Constitution"" and cities like Houston are trying to ""force women to go into men's bathrooms and men to go into women's bathrooms.""



""Now it's a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,"" he lamented, warning that ""the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff."" He explained: ""I don't want the wrath of God to hit this country, it's a great country, I'd like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we're going to have this financial collapse. We're setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that's probably the way he'd do it.""



At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: ""I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.""



""I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I'm thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,"" Robertson opined.

"UPDATE: Van Full Of Illegals Caught Voting At Multiple Alabama Polling Locations
The Democrat Party is up to their usual dirty tricks as Republican senate candidate Roy Moore fights against their cheating ways in an effort to become Alabama’s next senator.

According to the Birmingham Press, polling officials caught what appears to be a “van full of illegals” who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for Moore’s opponent Doug Jones.

“Law enforcement stopped the vehicle at Santa Recto Middle School in Wilmington as 13 Hispanic men were seen piling into a van after voting,” the Santa Recto Observer reported Tuesday afternoon. “The same men were also seen in Smithfield, Birmingham, La Croix, and Mobile and were reported as suspicious by voting officials.”

Members of the State Election Integrity Board began investigating the group of men at around 9 a.m. and tracking them around the state. Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for “dozens of fake votes” around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak.

This is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore “molesting” a young woman fail, they try to cheat. This is, of course, similar to a situation in California on Election Day 2016 when illegal aliens were busted trying to vote for Hillary Clinton.

All but one of the men were “undocumented” immigrants from Mexico, San Salmos, and Puerta Gorda. The last, Marcos Ramos, is a U.S. citizen and faces up to 13 years in prison for election fraud.

"WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO)
In a last ditch effort to take down Republican Alabama Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore, the mainstream media wheeled out discredited Gloria Allred accuser Beverly Young Nelson.

Big mistake. Nelson admitted on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” that she added “notes,” to what she claims is Moore’s signature inside her yearbook.

GMA : “Nelson says she did make notes to [Moore’s] inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore.” ABC HOST: “Beverly, he did sign your yearbook.” NELSON: “He did sign it.” ABC HOST: “And you made some notes underneath?” NELSON: “Yes.”

Beverly Young Nelson, one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, tells @GMA it “sickens” her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8, 2017

As The Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft reported, there are growing calls that Gloria Allred and Beverly Nelson should be charged with fraud.

And in case you missed it… The Gateway Pundit has previously posted on the several discrepancies with Beverly Nelson’s press conference.

Following The Gateway Pundit’s viral story on Judge Roy Moore’s alleged signature inside accuser Beverly Young Nelson’s yearbook, more evidence suggested it was a forgery.

CNN published photos of the signature showing two different inks.

The signature says “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House.”

Strangely, “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy,” is written in black ink, while “Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House,” is in blue ink.

"BREAKING: President Trump Signs Executive Order Stripping NFL Of ‘Non-Profit’ Status
The federal government grants some businesses the ability to pay reduced or no taxes because they are set up as a “non-profit.” The NFL is one of those businesses – or was, until Sunday evening when Donald Trump quietly signed an executive order removing the sports league’s non-profit status.

The order notes the un-American attitude displayed by the players, who repeatedly kneel during the National Anthem, burn flags in their locker rooms, and disrespect our country in every way imaginable.

To date, little has been done to stop players from disrespecting our military, our flag, and all they stand for, so President Trump “temporarily” revoked their 401(c)(3) status “until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.”

The NFL will be classified as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but the order allows the league to re-apply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 “if all of the problems are solved.”

The White House spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the President hopes to see all the “athletes protesting our police and our flag or otherwise using their positions to spread hate” fired and replaced with people who “love and respect America.”

The NFL has thus far refused comment.","1"

"First family visits D.C. shelter, highlights homeless veterans’ plight
President Obama, joined by his wife and daughters, served Thanksgiving dinner in a D.C. shelter Wednesday to highlight the administration's efforts to end homelessness among U.S veterans. The first family visited Friendship Place, which is located in the basement of St. Luke’s Church in Northwest Washington. The shelter, which received a $3.1 million grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs this year to improve its capacity to address veteran homelessness, operates the program Veterans First, a leading provider of housing services to veterans and their families in the area that currently serves 550 households.

The Obamas, along with some friends, served dinner as part of the shelter's ""Feast with Friends"" event. Each member of the family had assigned duties: The president served turkey and ladled gravy; Michelle Obama distributed vegetables; Malia doled out mashed potatoes; Sasha gave out stuffing and cranberry sauce and Marian Robinson dished out macaroni and cheese.

""We appreciate you,” the president said, asking another, “How you been?""

Obama also asked those partaking in the meal if they preferred white or dark meat.

The White House, which first launched an effort to end homelessness in June 2010, has intensified its push targeting homeless veterans this year. The mayors of the 25 cities with the largest populations of homeless veterans in the nation have publicly pledged to end veteran homelessness in their communities by the end of this year, and Virginia announced on Veterans Day it had become the first state to end homelessness among those who have served in the military.","1"

AND THE REASONING IS, HE’S NOT AFRAID TO MAKE DECISIONS. HE’S NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON THE — THE BIG MOUTHS AROUND HERE.”

O’Neal continued, “The president is smart, powerful and a good counterpuncher.I think he attacks anyone he perceives or believes is attacking him or the country.”

“He should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.” O’Neal added.

“THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO START FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH HIM INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING AND WASTING THEIR TIME ON STUPID THINGS.” HE CONCLUDED.

And Also What Ken Langone told CNBC:

If President Donald Trump is able to keep defying expectations — like he did in the election — and push through legislative changes against great odds, he could go down as “one of our greatest presidents ever,” Ken Langone told CNBC on Monday.

Langone, a longtime Republican supporter and the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, said the Trump presidency offers the GOP, which also controls the House and the Senate, a unique time to deliver on the reasons Americans voted for a political outsider for the White House.

Voters are “fed up,” Langone said on “Squawk Box.” “They did a very dramatic, earth-shattering thing,” and now want results, he said.

"Leonardo DiCaprio Tells President Obama That He's Going to Mars
Leonardo DiCaprio has sailed on the Titanic, battled grizzly bears in the brutal Wild West, and explored dreams. Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says he’s going to travel to Mars — but for real.

Well, at least that’s what he told President Barack Obama.

DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.

The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”

“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don’t want to know if anyone has, I think you’re crazy.”

As Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musk’s recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, “I did.”

Hayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didn’t actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in.

“I think he’ll acknowledge he’s crazy,” the president said with a smile.

It’s unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it.","1"

"BREAKING: Trump Caught INVESTING in Dakota Pipeline Before Signing It
CNBC reported that Trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline. Trump’s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.

Donald Trump’s business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.

The construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.

The pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.

Opposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.

The opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trump’s own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.

Veterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.

And now we learn that “President” Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.

This should come as no surprise since Trump ‘s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.

"BREAKING: Fox Star Tucker Carlson In Critical Condition After Head On Collision Driving Home
Fox News’ bright and shining primetime star, Tucker Carlson, was involved in a hit and run head-on collision on his way home from his live broadcast of “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” which is shot at Fox News in New York City. NYC Police Sargeant Michael O’Leary told reporters that while he couldn’t confirm the identity of the driver, a well-known news anchor was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident.

EMT’s on the scene were heard on their radios describing the man as Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson after retrieving his wallet. He was transported to Saint Mary’s where he is said to be in critical condition and awaiting surgery. No other information is available from the hospital, which also refuses to release anything until they get the OK from police.

The car that crossed the median and struck Carlson had a reinforced bumper and the steering wheel was covered with foam to provide the driver extra protection from a crash. It’s obvious that someone wanted to do harm to another human being on purpose. Whether or not Carlson was specifically targeted or just in the wrong place at the wrong time remains unknown.

"Texas law enforcement officer fatally shot upon arriving for work by 3 Muslim refugee. Do you support to deport them?
A highly regarded Texas law enforcement officer was shot and killed Monday moments after arriving for work in an attack that prompted a massive manhunt for the gunman.

The shooting of Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy Clinton Greenwood did not appear to be random, according to Baytown police Lt. Steve Dorris, but a motive was not immediately clear.

“Whether or not he was specifically targeted, or whether this was because of the uniform he was wearing or the place he pulled up to in the morning, we just don’t know that right now,” Dorris said.

No arrests had been made as of Monday evening. Dorris said authorities were still “actively investigating” the shooting.","1"
"Hurricane Irene: ‘Photo’ of shark swimming in street is fake
That’s because it is. Google ""shark,"" and up pops a great photo of a shark stalking a kayak from a 2005 issue of Africa Geographic.. Commenters on Reddit, where the photo seems to have originated, quickly noted this and the very real similarities between the two sharks (note the small circular shadow just below the shark's belly.)

Some sites have since realized their error. Neatorama, for example, has removed its story with the photo called ""Thank you, Hurricane Irene: Shark in the street."" We've asked Channel 7 in Miami, which broadcast the user-submitted photo, if it plans to inform viewers about its fakeness. We will update this post if we hear back.

This phenomenon is nothing new. After the death of Osama bin Laden, a fake photo of his body circulated on Arab news outlets. When the earthquake hit Japan, photographs of a damaged church started circulating. The church was located in Christchurch, New Zealand.

"Melania Trump undergoes kidney surgery at Walter Reed
CNN —

First lady Melania Trump underwent kidney surgery Monday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington, DC, according to a statement from her office.

Trump had been experiencing an issue with her kidney that her office described as benign but requiring medical attention.

“This morning, first lady Melania Trump underwent an embolization procedure to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was successful, and there were no complications,” the first lady’s communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement.

“Mrs. Trump is at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will likely remain there for the duration of the week. The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere,” Grisham wrote.

President Donald Trump remained in the White House during Melania Trump’s surgery. He tweeted just after 5 p.m. Monday that he was heading to hospital to visit his wife in Marine One.

“Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!” Trump tweeted.

Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018

Trump, who turned 48 last month, had surgery at Walter Reed in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, on Monday morning.

She is the first US first lady to undergo such a serious medical procedure while in the White House since Nancy Reagan had a mastectomy in October 1987. Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974.

"No, Sandra Bullock didn't disparage Hillary Clinton
A fake news article said actress Sandra Bullock praised President Donald Trump while telling Hillary Clinton she could leave the United States if she isn’t happy with how things are going.

""Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: ‘if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again, you are one jealous woman who is nothing to compare with Trump, I hope he will arrest you soon,’"" said a Dec. 25 headline on Flash 24 Daily.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October.

While the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didn’t include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name.

The article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her ""new film,"" Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate.

Sign up for PolitiFact texts

At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans.

""I don’t agree with that at all,"" Bullock said. ""That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don’t agree with that statement.""

The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock has adopted two African-American children -- a boy and a girl.

""I would like my rights represented and those of my son — very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them,"" she says. ""When this film came along, it came along at a time th","1"

"Malia Obama Arrested With A Gang Of Thugs In Chicago
Malia Obama may have done irreparable harm to her career this morning when she decided to join a gang of thugs in Chicago for a day of drinking, drugs and dogfighting at a public park in Chicago. Malia was arrested along with seven others and charged with wanton endangerment of animals, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance.

She was found in the company of mostly older men when police arrived after being called by a concerned citizen complaining about a loud group of people watching dogs fight in the park. According to a witness:

“They was all just right out there in the open drinkin’ and lettin’ their dogs go at it. I saw some smoking weed. Some were doing other things I don’t know. All those dudes had that baggy pants thing. They weren’t the types of people you’d expect that girl to be with.”

According to the Secret Service, Malia had slipped away late last night after being told open air parties at public parks were too dangerous. She wasn’t seen again until she showed up in the 12th precinct jail. Her parents have not been available for comment.

Public records show she was released on her own recognizance and given a court date of later this month for arraignment.","1"

"Somali Immigrant Crashes Car Into Ohio Families Home, Killing The Infant At Home – Daily Headlines
A woman in Columbus, Ohio, was arrested, charged and convicted after she hit and killed a 7-month-old baby with her car.

Muhuba Mohamed was found guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide after she struck a man who was pushing an infant in a stroller along the side of the road. Mohamed then crashed into a house.

The man pushing the stroller was identified as 23-year-old Kenan Ferebee, and the child was his 7-month-old son, Micah.

The baby was pronounced dead at an area hospital. The child’s father was taken to a different hospital in critical condition, WBNS reported.

A witness said Mohamed had a phone in her hand at the time of the crash, but there was no evidence of any texts or calls being received at the time. Four days earlier, the woman was in an accident in which she crashed into a median, The Columbus Dispatch reported. In both cases, she was driving on a temporary permit without an accompanying licensed driver.

“Not one of those single things amounts to recklessness,” Judge Laurel Beatty Blunt said. “But when you look at the totality of the circumstances, the court does rule that it does amount to reckless conduct.”

Mohamed, a native of Somalia, reportedly faced a prison sentence if convicted, but was allowed to remain free until her sentencing.

“If an American did the same thing they would be in jail for a long time,” one Mad World News reader commented on the site’s Facebook page. “She should get the same or more being the 2nd accident in 4 days. Going off the side of the road and running over 2 innocent people killing a helpless baby. Come on people. Give her life in prison. She deserves more than that but I’m sure she won’t get the death penalty. What in the hell kind of Justice system do we have now.”

"Archbishop Desmond Tutu dies while holidaying in Texas
HOUSTON, TEXAS – Anti-apartheid and human rights activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu has died in Texas at the age of 86.

His wife Leah Tutu told reporters that the couple were in Texas for holiday and had plans of greeting George H.W Bush who lost his wife few days ago.

According to Leah Tutu, Desmond Tutu was rushed to hospital in the wee hours of Saturday morning where he passed on. The cause of his death is not immediately known.

In August 2016, Tutu’s daughter Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe he was in the hospital for treatment of a recurring infection.

Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe may have described him as “evil”, but Archbishop Desmond Tutu remained a much-loved figure across the world – principally for his role in South Africa’s struggle against apartheid.

During the long years that Nelson Mandela was in prison, Archbishop Tutu spoke out against the regime – and won the Nobel peace prize in 1984 for his efforts.

He was chosen by President Mandela to chair South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and investigate the crimes committed by all sides during the apartheid regime.

Before his demise, “the Arch” – as he was known – had remained irrepressible and influential both in his native South Africa and on the global political stage.

He was chairman of a group of former world leaders called The Elders, launched on Nelson Mandela’s 89th birthday in 2007 with the aim of tackling some of the world’s most pressing problems.

"THIS ARTICLE RETRACTED: Red Crescent Says No Evidence of Chemical Attack in Syria’s Douma
Update:

The Syrian Arab Red Crescent statement was reported, and at the time we had no reason to believe it was not true. Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.

—

The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.

The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn’t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might’ve been exposed to.

(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)

Chemical attack or no, it wouldn’t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn’t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.

The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these “real” patients to confirm an attack.","1"
"The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads
Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain’s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.

Fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don’t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. “We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,” Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.

CNN has also released a statement: “The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.” But that still doesn’t really verify that anything occurred.

The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It’s a layup for body-part puns.

This is exactly how fake news spreads

But this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.

The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.","1"

"JUST IN: WaPo Reporter Who Broke News On Judge Roy Moore Story Has A Criminal History Of “Faking” * 100PercentFedUp.com * by Patty McMurray
Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is denying that he romantically pursued teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s after a bombshell report.

The women accusing Moore told the Washington Post that when they were between the ages of 14 and 18, he romantically pursued them.

One woman, Leigh Corfman, told the Post that when she was 14 years old in 1979, a 32-year-old Moore “took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes.”

Corfman told the Post that Moore “touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.”

The outspoken social conservative said in a statement the four women quoted by the Washington Post are lying.

“This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,” Moore said.

Lance Armstrong's defiant Twitter photo shows him relaxing with seven yellow jerseys

Lance Armstrong let his Twitter followers -- still 3.8 million strong -- know he was back in Austin this weekend and had someone take a picture to show how he was spending a lazy Saturday afternoon.

""Back in Austin and just layin' around,"" he wrote in the tweet. He attached a picture of himself laying on a couch in a room that just happened to have seven yellow Tour de France jerseys on the wall. Purely random, I'm sure.

It's not a #humblebrag as much as it's a #shoveitinyourfacebrag. It's cocky, it's condescending and it's not going to help Armstrong's battered public image. Contrition, not defiance, is the way to go.

Armstrong was banned for life last month by the International Cycling Union and stripped of those seven Tour wins. (The jerseys, apparently, can stay.)

Look, I'm on Lance Armstrong's side, as much as one can be on the side of a suspected/known cheater. His cycling wins may have been a sham (just like victories by most athletes in the sport) but his work for cancer research, awareness and patients has been inspirational. Would it have been better if Armstrong stayed clean, became a middling cyclist and Livestrong never existed? I don't see how any logical person could make that argument. Shades of gray cloud the picture, of course, but I still think his net contribution to our world is greater than his flaws.

Regardless, Armstrong stepped down Monday from the Livestrong board. He founded the charity in 1997.

If pictures like this are any indication, Armstrong has moved past denial into the anger phase of his coping. Next he'll be trying to buy Tour titles off Miguel Indurain, followed by his growing a beard phase and then he'll accept his actions, sit down for an interview with Oprah and get back into the good graces of the American public.

"BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT
BREAKING!

Liberal rag Huffington Post is really running with this story from The Washington Post about the CIA “confirming” Russian interference in the presidential election.

They’re saying if 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!

Scary!

From HuffPo:

A 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.

In light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald Trump’s victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.

At 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.

The development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become “faithless” or “conscientious” electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.

The electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton’s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation’s highest office. A pet","1"

The only person allowed to cast a ballot that counts in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is dead of an apparent high-powered gunshot wound to the head. North Korean State Television says the bullet came from the sniper rifle of an American positioned more than a mile away.

The report comes shortly after North Korea successfully tested a long-range ICBM capable of reaching Alaska and possibly Hawaii. Trump promised swift and appropriate action. This seems to be it.

Family released a statement saying he “went comfortably and was in no pain” and “lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.”

Kirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industry’s Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style.

As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs.

BREAKING: Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes Viral

A few days ago, a student at Harvard leaked the contents of Malia Obama’s speech final. The topic? A World Without Whites. And now it may get Malia Obama suspended.

“White people are so 1960’s. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30,” a recording of Obama’s speech shared on Snapchat said. “Imagine a world without white people.” Obama was of course referring to the scientific belief that if whites continue to breed at low rates in America while others races continue to breed at current rates, white babies will be virtually nonexistent in our country by 2038.

A post quoting Obama was shared more than 14,000 times with a reach of nearly 1 million Americans, which forced Harvard to take action.

“This sort of attack against any race is uncalled for,” Harvard Dean Cain Markholder said in a statement Sunday. “Ms. Obama has been informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement.” But it gets worse for Obama — Markholder says that if a disciplinary board finds her guilty, she will “forfeit her grade for the exam” which is worth 47% of her grade according to one of the students who shared video of her racist hate speech-filled attack on whites.

"New Law Makes it Illegal to Shower and Do Laundry on Same Day
California Governor Jerry Brown just signed a draconian new law that makes it illegal to take a shower, and do laundry on the same day:

Assembly Bill 1668 establishes a limit of 55 gallons per person daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, starting in the year 2022. Violators will have to pay a fine of $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day if “the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years,” the law states.

According to the attentive folks at The Organic Prepper, this allotted water ration exceeds the amount required for taking a shower and doing a single load of laundry and excludes taking baths altogether.

Writer Daisy Luther notes that an ordinary load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of water, while an eight-minute shower uses some 17 gallons of water. A bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of water. This means combining a shower and laundry on the same day would use 57 gallons of water, two gallons above the limit.

According to the new law, the 55-gallon per person limit will be reduced even further in future years, dropping to 52.5 gallons per capita in 2025 and just 50 gallons per person in 2030.

To ensure compliance, the government of California urges the use of creative surveillance systems to spy on all residents. Utility providers will be obligated to report on violators, and urban retail water suppliers “shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas.”

So as not to overburden the wealthy, there will be “provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features,” the law states. …

"JUST IN TODAY: Trey Gowdy Is The NEW DIRECTOR Of The FBI!
A huge new development in Washington, D.C. may be putting American security back on track. This is great news for American patriots everywhere, and we need to get behind it!

According to various sources, FBI Director James Comey might soon be replaced by the Trump Administration. Even better, Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC) is already being touted as Comey’s successor, via US Defense Watch.

For those unaware of Gowdy’s many accomplishments, suffice it to say that the South Carolina conservative has been one of the more vocal critics of the Obama Administration for quite some time now.

More recently, Representative Gowdy has been a voice of reason regarding the Democrat fixation on the idea of President Trump’s supposed connections to Vladimir Putin. He’s even gone on record defending California Republican Devin Nunes from Democrat attacks on his integrity and his ability to properly investigate whether Obama spied on Trump during the 2016 campaign, via Townhall.

A long-time favorite of the Tea Party and other conservative groups, Gowdy is the type of man the Trump Administration needs to clean up the leftovers of the Obama Administration and its “Deep State” allies.

At approximately 9:18 a.m. on Wednesday, attorneys for Hillary Rodham Clinton filed an Action For Divorce with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County, according to documents obtained by Christian Times Newspaper.

Citing irreconcilable differences, the former Democratic nominee for President apparently is seeking a divorce from her longtime husband former President Bill Clinton.

Bill Clinton is named as the defendant in the legal filing, and Hillary’s signature appears beside her listing as the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s signature is often included in these types of filings to certify and expedite the legal process.

According to the filing obtained by CTN, the couple has a previously agreed-upon separation agreement or stipulation that will govern the manner in which the marital property is to be distributed in the event the divorce is finalized. It is unclear at this time what that agreement specifically covers.

CTN has censored the couple’s address and the contact information for Hillary’s attorney in the respect of their privacy.

At this time, the Clinton’s are not commenting on the breaking news of their imminent divorce. The Clinton’s got married on October 11, 1975, in Fayetteville, Arkansas in the living room of their new red brick home. 15 of their closest friends and family were present, and the reception took place in their backyard.

The couple’s marriage has been a mystery for years after it was discovered that Bill Clinton carried on multiple affairs while Governor of Arkansas, President of the United States, and even after his time in public office.

It has been alleged in the past that the couple has a purely professional relationship and that they haven’t slept in the same bed for years

We work to ensure that these irreplaceable items are preserved and made available for the widest possible use.

Presidential Libraries and Museums give you the chance to see, hear, and participate in the events that changed our lives and shaped our national story.

History

How did the Presidential Library System begin?

It all began with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the late 1930s.

A dramatic increase in the volume of Presidential papers led Roosevelt to seek the advice of prominent historians and public figures on how and where to keep not only his White House files, but also his earlier papers, book collection, and memorabilia.

Roosevelt announced plans for a new type of facility, a Presidential Library, on December 10, 1938. An organization was chartered to raise private funds for the construction of the building on Roosevelt’s Hyde Park estate.

On July 18, 1939, Congress passed a joint resolution accepting the new facility and agreeing to operate it as part of the National Archives. The Roosevelt Library was turned over to the Federal government on July 4, 1940, and dedicated on June 30, 1941.

The Roosevelt Library became the model for subsequent Presidential Libraries. Succeeding Libraries have been constructed with pr","1"
"Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book
Washington, DC — A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.

Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book “The Black House,” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.

In an interview with CNN, Horner told Victor Berman that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well.

“Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge,” Horner said. “I saw many men coming and going from Obama’s room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.”





Berman: “In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?”

Horner: “When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn’t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.”

Berman: “Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various “tortures” that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?”

Horner: “Because I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.”





Berman: “Can you give us any insight on Obama’s feelings towards the American people?”

Horner: “He constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as “mongoloids” and “idiots”. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he ac","1"
"‘The Daily Show’s’ Michelle Wolf Lands Her Own Netflix Late-Night Show (Exclusive)
Michelle Wolf has landed a show of her own.

After nearly half a decade working on Late Night With Seth Meyers and The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, Wolf is set to host her own weekly show on Netflix. The streaming giant, which is making a considerable push in the talk-show space with entries from David Letterman and Joel McHale, is billing Wolf’s show as a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy. The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.

The 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda — unless, of course, it’s funny. “You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV,” Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflix’s vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: “We’re thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.”

The announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (“I want equal pay! And a chardonnay”) to dating and other social issues.

Though Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his 2016 stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony.

By jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central — and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable network’s Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People,","1"

"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption
USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption

You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.

New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.

Where do these horses come from?

While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.

Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.

Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.

Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.

Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you","1"

"ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry's Impassioned Plea To 'Like, Just Co-Exist'
MAYADIN, SYRIA - Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, ""The greatest thing we can do just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.""

The powerful statement which single-handedly dismantled ISIS came shortly after a terrorist attack on civilians in Manchester killed 22 people, and led the reclusive head of ISIS to hold an emergency press conference declaring the group's jihad finished.

""Despite my previous belief that we must slay the infidel in the name of Allah until Islam rules the world, I just can't deny that Katy's words have touched my heart,"" al-Baghdadi said as he symbolically held up and then tossed an AK-47 onto the ground. ""It is time for the mujahideen to start uniting and loving on people.""

""I just can't believe we didn't see it before. It's all so clear now,"" he added.

After the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.

According to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace.","1"

"International Arrest Warrant Issued for George Soros
George Soros—the Billionaire investment banker who has admitted to manipulating the financial markets in Asia, the UK, Greece, and Russia has finally gone too far.

You see Mr. Soros has become persona non grata across the globe for his role in destabilizing country’s economy’s and financial markets. He does so for the sole intent of lining his own pockets at the expense of others.

George Soros now lives in the United States and has been involved in many of the anti-Trump protests around the country. He has paid salaries and housing for many of the leaders of Black Lives Matters group, in addition to paying young people to protest Donald Trump in multiple big cities across the U.S.

He has done this before in different countries throughout Europe and Asia. Basically, he causes massive financial chaos in a country, cashes in on it, and moves to the next one.

Russia was once a victim of his demented financial upheaval. Back in the ‘90’s he wrote a letter that besmirched the Russian currency and said it was overvalued. Investors immediately panicked and dumped the Russian currency. The results of which pushed Russia into a financial depression which ultimately benefitted the billionaire in his deep, greedy pockets.

Ever since then Russia has held a grudge against Soros. Although it took years, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin officially issued an international arrest warrant for George Soros for his role in collapsing Russia’s currency and the resulting financial meltdown.

"Police Discover Meth Lab In Back Room of Alabama Walmart
0

DECATUR, Alabama –

Police were recently tipped off to a reported meth lab that was being run by Walmart employees in what they are calling one of the biggest busts in decades.

Police Chief Robert Garner said that an anonymous tip was left on their drug hotline, expressing concern about a horrible burning smell that was coming from the back of the Decatur WalMart facility. When an officer was sent to investigate, the store was instantly shut down as he discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room.

“The thing was massive, and contained enough materials to make hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds of crystal meth,” said Chief Garner. “Apparently, every employee in the store was a part of it, from working with and gathering materials, to cooking, to selling it outside of the store. It was a full, massive operation.”

No one from Walmart’s corporate office was available for comment, but an unofficial spokesperson did say that they were “disappointed” that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down.

"Rubio: “Rape Victims Should Be In Custody If There Is Suspicion That They’re Planning Abortion”
At a campaign town hall event at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with “radical” positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.

“I don’t know what you’re talking – I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. That’s what I believe,” declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. “I believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process that’s been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,” Rubio asserted.



Taking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would “put rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.”

“I’m just totally against the whole shebang, I won’t deny it,” Rubio said. “I am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it’s father has done to you, come on.”

He added: “That is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the","1"

"Lindsey Graham Threatens To Convert To Democrat If Republicans Don’t Dump Trump – True Trumpers
During a time when the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, should be working to bring the party together and prepare for the primary battle against Hillary Clinton, he continues to deepen the divide between Republicans and Americans alike.

Trump’s recent attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his Mexican-American background prompted Sen. Lindsey Graham to round up the Republicans who have previously endorsed Donald Trump, and persuade them to take it all back.

Graham claimed that Trump’s racist remarks were “the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy.”

“If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,” Graham told The New York Times.”

Senator Graham elaborated on this during an interview with NBC News’ Hallie Jackson.

“There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me,” he said. “But there’ll come a point in time where we’re gonna have to understand that it’s not just about the 2016 race, it’s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can’t.”

Donald Trump claimed that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case, has been biased toward him because of his Latino heritage.

“I couldn’t disagree more with a statement like that,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday.

“Those kinds of comments are very serious to me,” Rep. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said to News radio WGAN. “They are completely unacceptable, and what they indicate — which is why I think this is so serious — is a lack of respect for our judicial system and for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in the Constitution.”

Romney makes pitch, hoping to close deal

Photo by Matt McClain

Mitt Romney offered a pragmatic view of the tight Republican race for president Friday at a Denver car dealership, saying that some states are ""long shots"" for him while others are there for the taking.

Colorado, he believed, fell into the latter category - which is why he made the stop in Denver on his way to Utah to attend funeral services for Gordon B. Hinckley.

Hinckley, 97, was president of the Mormon church, of which Romney is a member.

Romney, standing in the parking lot of Freeway Ford, stood with his sleeves rolled up, despite the rapidly dropping temperature, and offered a broad view of Super Tuesday's contest featuring 21 states, including Colorado, holding Republican caucuses or primaries.

""At this stage, I expect to keep on battling and get the nomination,"" he said. ""I'm not going to forecast anything but success.""

The campaign is targeting a series of states in the next few days that Romney could play well in. After Utah, where he enjoys strong support, the former Massachusetts governor will head to Minnesota.

His campaign didn't rule out another trip to Colorado before Tuesday.

The state has seen massive campaign activity this week as Super Tuesday nears, with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama drawing about 13,000 people at the University of Denver and former President Bill Clinton, stumping for his wife Sen. Hillary Clinton, bringing in about 4,500 at the same location.

Dealership cites 'civic duty'

Romney's event drew about 1,200 supporters, who were shoehorned into the car dealership showroom. It was a last-minute change of venue.

The campaign had planned to host the rally at the Harley Davidson dealership in Thornton, but contacted Freeway Ford General Manager and Vice President Mike Peebles to see if they could have the event there after the motorcycle dealership's owner pulled the ","0"
"Donald Trump exaggerates when he says China has 'total control' over North Korea
During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic grounds. But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea.

Trump said, ""China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.""

With the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""

When we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Korea’s supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of ""total control.""

""China does not ‘control’ North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,"" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies.

Key Concepts A massive switch from coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear power plants to solar power plants could supply 69 percent of the U.S.’s electricity and 35 percent of its total energy by 2050.

A vast area of photovoltaic cells would have to be erected in the Southwest. Excess daytime energy would be stored as compressed air in underground caverns to be tapped during nighttime hours.

Large solar concentrator power plants would be built as well.

A new direct-current power transmission backbone would deliver solar electricity across the country.

But $420 billion in subsidies from 2011 to 2050 would be required to fund the infrastructure and make it cost-competitive. —The Editors

High prices for gasoline and home heating oil are here to stay. The U.S. is at war in the Middle East at least in part to protect its foreign oil interests. And as China, India and other nations rapidly increase their demand for fossil fuels, future fighting over energy looms large. In the meantime, power plants that burn coal, oil and natural gas, as well as vehicles everywhere, continue to pour millions of tons of pollutants and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually, threatening the planet.

Well-meaning scientists, engineers, economists and politicians have proposed various steps that could slightly reduce fossil-fuel use and emissions. These steps are not enough. The U.S. needs a bold plan to free itself from fossil fuels. Our analysis convinces us that a massive switch to solar power is the logical answer.

Solar energy’s potential is off the chart. The energy in sunlight striking the earth for 40 minutes is equivalent to global energy consumption for a year. The U.S. is lucky to be endowed with a vast resource; at least 250,000 square miles of land in the Southwest alone are suitable for constructing solar power plants, and that land receives more than 4,500 quadrillion British thermal unit","0"

"Summary of the Affordable Care Act
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148)

Overall approach to expanding access to coverage Require most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health insurance. Create state-based American Health Benefit Exchanges through which individuals can purchase coverage, with premium and cost-sharing credits available to individuals/families with income between 133-400% of the federal poverty level (the poverty level is $19,530 for a family of three in 2013) and create separate Exchanges through which small businesses can purchase coverage. Require employers to pay penalties for employees who receive tax credits for health insurance through an Exchange, with exceptions for small employers. Impose new regulations on health plans in the Exchanges and in the individual and small group markets. Expand Medicaid to 133% of the federal poverty level.

INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

Requirement to have coverage Require U.S. citizens and legal residents to have qualifying health coverage. Those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5% of household income. The penalty will be phased-in according to the following schedule: $95 in 2014, $325 in 2015, and $695 in 2016 for the flat fee or 1.0% of taxable income in 2014, 2.0% of taxable income in 2015, and 2.5% of taxable income in 2016. Beginning after 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment. Exemptions will be granted for financial hardship, religious objections, American Indians, those without coverage for less than three months, undocumented immigrants, incarcerated individuals, those for whom the lowest cost plan option exceeds 8% of an individual’s income, and those with incomes below the tax filing threshold (in 2009 the threshold for taxpayers under age 65 was $9,350 for singles and $18,700 for couples).

May 9, 2010 — -- TAPPER: Good morning, and a happy Mother's Day to all the moms watching. We'll begin with a Sunday first, Attorney General Eric Holder. Welcome to ""This Week.""

HOLDER: It's good to be here.

TAPPER: Well, let's start with the latest on the investigation into the failed Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad. What's the latest?

HOLDER: Well, we've now developed evidence that shows that the Pakistani Taliban was behind the attack. We know that they helped facilitate it. We know that they probably helped finance it and that he was working at their direction.

TAPPER: Is there any evidence that there's a cell that Shahzad was working with in the United States? Or was it just him operating from directions from Pakistan?

HOLDER: All I can really say is that the investigation is ongoing and we are examining overseas connections that he might have, as well as any people he might have worked with here in the United States. But the investigation's ongoing in both those spheres.

TAPPER: In the last few days, U.S. officials have met with Pakistani officials, and the message, as conveyed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on ""60 Minutes"" is this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CLINTON: We want more. We expect more. We've made it very clear that if, heaven forbid, an attack like this that we can trace back to Pakistan were to have been successful, there would be very severe consequences.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: What would those consequences be? And what more do you need the Pakistanis to be doing, the Pakistani government, beyond increased military action in North Waziristan, where the Pakistani Taliban is primarily located?

HOLDER: Well, in connection with the Shahzad investigation, they had been, I think, extremely aggressive, they've been cooperative with us, and I think we have been satisfied with the work that they have done. We want to make sure that kind of cooperation continues. To the extent that it does not, we ","0"
"Impeachment Talk Becomes a Cynical Game
Impeachment talk becomes a cynical game

On Friday, a top White House aide said it was possible Republicans could impeach President Obama if he decided to take executive action on immigration. Days later, on Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner fired back at this impeachment chatter: “Listen, it’s all a scam started by Democrats at the White House.” But let’s be honest here: Both sides -- Democrats and Republicans -- believe the impeachment talk is good for motivating their base. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says it’s raked in more than $3 million in online donations since Thursday with solicitations like this one from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (“Boehner is planning a vote to sue the president. The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting President in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next step”). Democrats also hope the impeachment talk can force a replay of 1998, when the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton backfired against the GOP that midterm season. As for Boehner and House Republicans, they’re being disingenuous, too. The GOP base loves the impeachment talk (see Sarah Palin, Allen West, Drudge, and the rhetoric from some sitting House members). Indeed, Boehner’s lawsuit seems intended to tap into that conservative impeachment enthusiasm -- but without going all the way to impeachment. It’s impeachment-lite. The House will vote tonight on that lawsuit against the president, per NBC’s Frank Thorp.

And it’s beneath the White House and the speaker

So both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country’s problems. (Republicans: “This President is breaking the law!” Democrats: “They want to impeach the president!”) And what’s particularly jarring is that this isn’t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather fro","0"

10 things to know about McCain

For all the coverage this week of Senator John McCain's background, there are some important things you won't learn about him from the TV networks. His carefully crafted positive image relies on people not knowing this stuff—and you might be surprised by some of it.

Please check out the list below, and then forward it to your friends, family, and coworkers. We can't rely on the media to tell folks about the real John McCain—but if we all pass this along, we can reach as many people as CNN Headline News does on a good night.

10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't):

John McCain voted against establishing a national holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Now he says his position has ""evolved,"" yet he's continued to oppose key civil rights laws.1 According to Bloomberg News, McCain is more hawkish than Bush on Iraq, Russia and China. Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan says McCain ""will make Cheney look like Gandhi.""2 His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban.3

McCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, ""I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.""4 The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.5 He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. The Associated Press reports he and his wife own at least eight homes! Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a ""second job"" and skip their vacations.6 Many of McCain's fellow Republican senators say he's too reckless to be c","0"
"Hillary Clinton says guns exceed next nine categories as leading cause of death for young black men
In a speech posted on Medium, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a striking statistic about gun violence and minority youth.

""Gun violence,"" she wrote, ""is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.""

We wondered whether this is correct, so we took a closer look.

We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014.

So even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton’s statement correct.

If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further.

There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns.

We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age an","0"

"'This Week' Transcript: Pelosi and Gates
August 1, 2010 — -- AMANPOUR: Madam Speaker, thank you so much for joining me.

PELOSI: My pleasure.

AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about some of the important news that's been made this week, particularly in -- in the House and that would be on Afghanistan.

Last year, 32 Democrats voted against the funding of the war in Afghanistan. This year, 102 Democrats voted against. That seems to be a dramatic rejection from the president's own party of his major strategic goal.

PELOSI: Well, not quite. You have to put the votes in perspective.

Our president came in. He was president maybe two months, three months, by the time we took the vote last year. And the Republicans said they weren't going to vote for the funding. And so it took all Democratic votes.

I persuaded my members to give this president a chance, to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan. And in -- and in the course of time -- now the Republicans said they would vote for it, it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in Afghanistan.

AMANPOUR: Now, you didn't vote.

PELOSI: No.

AMANPOUR: I know the speaker doesn't have to vote.

PELOSI: Right.

AMANPOUR: But how would you have voted?

PELOSI: Well, we brought the bill to the floor. And that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was -- what they needed to have would be provided for them. So we will never abandon our men and women in uniform. On the other hand, it gave our members a chance to express their view.

AMANPOUR: How long do you think you can keep your skeptical members, as you call them, on side?

PELOSI: Well, again, we have a -- varying degrees of expression here. We are there, we've taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the American people. And that's what people will be looking at -- how does this figure into our protecting the American people?

Is it worth it?

"No, We Can’t? Or Won’t? - The New York Times
If you were shocked by Friday’s job report, if you thought we were doing well and were taken aback by the bad news, you haven’t been paying attention. The fact is, the United States economy has been stuck in a rut for a year and a half.

Yet a destructive passivity has overtaken our discourse. Turn on your TV and you’ll see some self-satisfied pundit declaring that nothing much can be done about the economy’s short-run problems (reminder: this “short run” is now in its fourth year), that we should focus on the long run instead.

This gets things exactly wrong. The truth is that creating jobs in a depressed economy is something government could and should be doing. Yes, there are huge political obstacles to action — notably, the fact that the House is controlled by a party that benefits from the economy’s weakness. But political gridlock should not be conflated with economic reality.

Our failure to create jobs is a choice, not a necessity — a choice rationalized by an ever-shifting set of excuses.","0"

Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15–30 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you’ve ever really known.

And that’s exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you who’ve benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families.

I’m sure this election has been stressful for you.

It can’t be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nation’s problems. That’s not fair, it’s not kind, and it’s also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger.

Many of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. You’ve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldn’t be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are.

I want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential — that’s what makes our country great, and that’s the promise I’m going to fight to fulfill.

Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: Apostolic Church of God

Chicago, IL | June 15, 2008

Good morning. It's good to be home on this Father's Day with my girls, and it's an honor to spend some time with all of you today in the house of our Lord.

At the end of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus closes by saying, “Whoever hears these words of mine, and does them, shall be likened to a wise man who built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.” [Matthew 7: 24-25]

Here at Apostolic, you are blessed to worship in a house that has been founded on the rock of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. But it is also built on another rock, another foundation – and that rock is Bishop Arthur Brazier. In forty-eight years, he has built this congregation from just a few hundred to more than 20,000 strong – a congregation that, because of his leadership, has braved the fierce winds and heavy rains of violence and poverty; joblessness and hopelessness. Because of his work and his ministry, there are more graduates and fewer gang members in the neighborhoods surrounding this church. There are more homes and fewer homeless. There is more community and less chaos because Bishop Brazier continued the march for justice that he began by Dr. King's side all those years ago. He is the reason this house has stood tall for half a century. And on this Father's Day, it must make him proud to know that the man now charged with keeping its foundation strong is his son and your new pastor, Reverend Byron Brazier.

Of all the rocks upon which we build our lives, we are reminded today that family is the most important. And we are called to recognize and honor how critical every father is to that foundation. They are teachers and coaches. They are mentors and role models. They are examples of success and the men who constantly push us toward it.

I am delighted to be back here at Stanford. And I will never forget the day that we first brought Chelsea here. I brought her to visit when she was thinking about schools, but I knew as soon as she saw Stanford that this is where, if she were fortunate enough to be admitted, she would certainly choose to come. And, of course, I remember when Bill and I brought her here to begin her freshman year, and then the dinner for parents that Mike was referring to. So it’s a great treat to be back.

And now that my daughter is a mother herself—you can imagine—there’s already talk, at least among one or two members of our family, since her husband is also an alum of Stanford, about how good Charlotte would look one day in Cardinal red.

Targeting journalists, the Bush administration has engaged in direct assault, intimidation, imprisonment and information blackouts to limit the ability of journalists to do their jobs. The principal target these past seven years has been Al-Jazeera, the Arabic television network based in Doha, Qatar.

"Marco Rubio says Ted Cruz voted for defense cuts in Rand Paul's budget proposal
Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.

""He talks tough on some of these issues,"" Rubio said Dec. 13. ""For example, he was going to ‘carpet bomb’ ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""

Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians, who typically favor less defense spending.

We decided to fact-check Rubio’s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.

Cruz’s vote on Rand Paul’s budget proposal

Sign up for PolitiFact texts

Rubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.

Paul’s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.

Rubio’s campaign pointed to Paul’s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:

""This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,"" Paul wrote. ""It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.""

Under Paul’s proposal, defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023","0"

"Strong Words in Ohio as Obama and Clinton Press On
WESTERVILLE, Ohio  Like rival warships pulling into the same small harbor, Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton held rallies hours apart and exchanged oratorical barrages here Sunday.

Mr. Obama, of Illinois, struck at Mrs. Clinton’s claim to expertise in the arena of national security, saying she had one moment of transformative decision  Iraq  and she fumbled it.

“What precise foreign-policy experience is she claiming that makes her qualified to answer that telephone call at 3 a.m. in the morning?” Mr. Obama asked an audience of more than 3,000 in a high school gymnasium and overflow rooms here. “When it came to making the most important decision of our generation, Senator Clinton got it wrong.”

Mrs. Clinton’s take on Mr. Obama hours earlier was not much more forgiving. She again suggested that his speeches were empty and that the first-term senator was too green to occupy the Oval Office in a time of crisis.","0"

— -- Though he touts his outstanding memory, when Donald Trump was asked under oath about his dealings with a twice-convicted Russian émigré who served prison time and had documented mafia connections, the real estate mogul was at a loss.

Even though the man, Felix Sater, had played a role in a number of high-profile Trump-branded projects across the country.

“If he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like,” Trump testified in a video deposition for a civil lawsuit two years ago.

In recent weeks, the Republican Presidential candidate has been fending off critics who have accused him of embellishment, insensitivity and in some cases inaccuracy for his descriptions of the Muslim response to 9/11. Trump also dismissed outrage at his purported mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter, saying he simply does not remember meeting the scribe.

Away from the spotlight, Donald Trump has also been seeking to minimize his past business ties with Sater, the Russian émigré who appeared in photos with Trump, and carried a Trump Organization business card with the title “Senior Advisor to Donald Trump.”

REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

ON A NEW STRATEGY FOR AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN

Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building

9:40 A.M. EDT



THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Please be seated.

Before I begin today, let me acknowledge, first of all, Your Excellencies, all the ambassadors who are in attendance. I also want to acknowledge both the civilians and our military personnel that are about to be deployed to the region. And I am very grateful to all of you for your extraordinary work.

I want to acknowledge General David Petraeus, who's here, and has been doing an outstanding job at CENTCOM, and we appreciate him. I want to thank Bruce Reidel -- Bruce is down at the end here -- who has worked extensively on our strategic review. I want to acknowledge Karl Eikenberry, who's here, and is our Ambassador-designate to Afghanistan. And to my national security team, thanks for their outstanding work.

Today, I'm announcing a comprehensive, new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. And this marks the conclusion of a careful policy review, led by Bruce, that I ordered as soon as I took office. My administration has heard from our military commanders, as well as our diplomats. We've consulted with the Afghan and Pakistani governments, with our partners and our NATO allies, and with other donors and international organizations. We've also worked closely with members of Congress here at home. And now I’d like to speak clearly and candidly to the American people.

The situation is increasingly perilous. It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Attacks against our troops","0"
"At Trump hotel site, immigrant workers wary
For weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city’s newest luxury hotels. But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project — billionaire developer Donald Trump — put himself at the center of the nation’s debate over illegal immigration.

Trump garnered headlines — and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him — when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and “rapists” crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.

But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump’s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs — while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.

Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments. Here are some of the key moments. (Video: The Washington Post)

All of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16.

Transcript: ""This Week"" with Lamar McKay McKay, Janet Napolitano, Ken Salazar and Thad Allen

TAPPER: Good morning. We'll get to our main story on the oil spill in a moment, but first a breaking news from overnight. A car bomb discovered in New York's Times Square. Police cleared thousands of people from the streets after finding an SUV loaded with propane tanks, gasoline, black powder and a timing device, the makings of what appeared to be a crude car bomb. The situation is now safe, but joining me this morning is Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. And Secretary Napolitano, I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about this.

First of all, I know that the federal government is treating this as a potential terrorist attack and that you have some evidence, you're dusting for fingerprints. But this attempted attack resembles car bomb attempts in London and Scotland in 2007. How concerned are you that this is not an isolated incident?

NAPOLITANO: Well, right now, we have no evidence that it is anything other than a one-off, but we are alerting state, local officials around the country, letting them know what is going on. The forensics are being done. As leads evolve or develop, they will all be tracked down. This is getting attention. FBI, Department of Homeland Security, New York City police, everybody is on it.

TAPPER: I got to think that Times Square is one of the most surveilled areas in the entire world. How close are we to finding a suspect?

NAPOLITANO: Well, right now, it is heavily surveilled, and as you know, there are cameras all over, and so tape is being reviewed. But traditional forensics are being done in addition to that.

July 11, 2010 — -- JAKE TAPPER, HOST: I know that there are some in the White House who feel Wall Street reform, health care legislation, stimulus, and yet the public still overwhelmingly thinks this country is on the wrong track.

Are you not getting enough credit, you and the administration?

JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, these are gigantic packages to deal with a gigantic problem we inherited. And the vast majority of the American people and a lot of people really involved don't even know what's inside the packages. And so you have, for example, Mr. Boehner already calling for the repeal of -- of the reform that just passed on Wall Street. People don't realize, in that reform, you know, you say, look, we've had meat inspection for 100 years ago, the meat packing companies didn't like it. Automobile safety 50 years ago.

People are going to look back on this very shortly and say, why shouldn't we have some consumer group in -- entity looking at whether or not you can give someone a mortgage with no down payment, with no -- with a teaser interest rate, with no documentation, etc.

So it is -- people don't know that. Just like people don't know a lot of what's going on in The Recovery Act, understandably, because this has been so much stuff that has been flowing our way. And -- and we're facing a bunch of guys who are good guys, but they're all about repeal and -- and repeat. Repeal what we're doing and go back, repeal the incentives for industry to invest in solar energy. Repeal the health care bill that allows you to keep your kid on your health care policy, precondi -- preexisting conditions can't deny you policies, etc.

It's just going to take time. This is Jan -- this is July. The election is not until November. And I think we're going to have to firmly make our case. I think we can make it and especially in the context of who's going to be opposing us.

Mitt Romney

From Foreign Affairs, July/August 2007

Summary: Washington is as divided on foreign policy as it has been at any point in the last 50 years. As the ""greatest generation"" did before us, we must move beyond political camps to unite around bold actions in order to build a strong America and a safer world. We must strengthen our military and economy, achieve energy independence, reenergize civilian and interagency capabilities, and revitalize our alliances. Mitt Romney, Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.

Topics:

U.S. policy and politics

National security and defense

WASHINGTON DIVIDED Less than six years after 9/11, Washington is as divided and conflicted over foreign policy as it has been at any point in the last 50 years. Senator Arthur Vandenberg once famously declared that ""politics stops at the water's edge""; today, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declares that our major political parties should carry out two separate foreign policies. The Senate unanimously confirmed General David Petraeus, who pledged to implement a new strategy, as the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. Yet just weeks later, the Senate began crafting legislation specifically designed to stop that new strategy. More broadly, lines have been drawn between those labeled ""realists"" and those labeled ""neoconservatives."" Yet these terms mean little when even the most committed neoconservative recognizes that any successful policy must be grounded in reality and even the most hardened realist admits that much of the United States' power and influence stems from its values and ideals. In the midst of these divisions, the American people -- and many others around the world -- have increasing doubts about the United States' direction and role in the world. Indeed, it seems that concern about Washington's divi","0"
"Krugman calls Senate health care bill similar to law in Massachusetts
The recent Massachusetts Senate election captivated Americans far beyond the Bay State. In that contest, Republican Scott Brown picked up a seat formerly held by the late Democratic giant Edward Kennedy. Brown's upset victory was aided by a wave of frustration over how Congress and President Barack Obama have been handling health care reform legislation.



During the campaign, Brown said that if he was elected, he would become the 41st Republican senator, enabling the GOP to block the Democratic majority from reaching the 60-vote threshold required to pass key legislation, including a health care bill. The Senate has already passed a version of health care, but it needs to be reconciled with a different bill passed by the House and then signed by the president before it becomes law.



As it happened, Massachusetts passed its own health care reform plan in 2006, with the help of both Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and a heavily Democratic legislature. Brown, then serving in the state Senate, voted for the plan.



On the Jan. 31, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, host Barbara Walters asked Brown about his vote on the Massachusetts plan. ""Why isn't what's good for Massachusetts good for the whole country?"" she asked.



Brown responded, ""In Massachusetts, the free market, the free enterprise has taken control, and they're offering a wide range of plans. I've never ever said that people should not get health insurance. It's just a question of if we're going to take a one-size-fits-all government plan or we're going to do something where the individual states can tailor their plans as we've done.""



When Walters asked him, ""Do you think the whole plan should be scrapped?"" Brown said, ""Yes.""



""The whole plan?"" Walters continued.



""Yes,"" Brown said.



Later, during the show's round-table segment, liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman expressed disbelief at Brown's response.

"Philando Castile Had Been Stopped 52 Times By Police
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn't unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.

He was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.

Was Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?

The answer may never be known, but Castile's stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile's girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.

The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile's killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.

The Castile video ""is pretty horrific,"" said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. ""There are things we don't know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.""

Court records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.

Many charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most freq","0"

Testimony of Wayne R. LaPierre

Executive Vice-President, National Rifle Association

before the

House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime

U. S. House of Representatives May 27, 1999

Our freedoms are already endangered enough by those who oppose them. But I 've learned that a freedom is most at risk when it 's in the hands of honest people who think, for some perceived common good, they ought to give it up.



Today we are a country in shock, still bewildered by what confluence of forces could possibly lead young people to hurt each other.



In that tender state, good people are vulnerable. They want to do something, anything, for the common good. Indeed, some are so perplexed about what to do that legislators admit from the outset that their legislation could not have prevented the very crimes that provoked drafting it.



That's the very definition of a perceived, but fictitious, common good.



As this made-for-TV lawmaking gets played out, it needs a villain. So good Americans have been exposed daily to a well-coordinated systematic bashing of the National Rifle Association 's membership as somehow a reckless societal pathogen, a mighty extremist empire opposed to safety, caution, and reason.



That is a cruel and dangerous lie.



Because nobody --nor any combination of entities you care to add up --has invested even a measurable fraction of what we have invested toward keeping safety and sanity central to the lawful exercise of the Second Amendment.



And nobody is more committed than we are to keeping guns out of criminals 'hands. That's obviously in our best interest. It's just whether you believe you 're more likely to keep guns and criminals apart with new laws you write and ignore, or with existing laws you enforce.



Some think our insistence on enforcement is unreasonable. Others say we oppose reasonable restrictions on gun ownership. So let's talk about what's reasonable and what's not.

— -- This is a transcript of the interview ABC News’ chief anchor George Stephanopoulos conducted with President Barack Obama on November 12, 2015 at the White House.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Okay, Mr. President, thank you for doing this.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Great to be here, George.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about ISIS to begin with. Did they bring down that Russian plane?

OBAMA: Well, we don't know that yet. It is a possibility

STEPHANOPOULOS: Just a possibility?

OBAMA: Well, we don't know. I think we're still looking at all the details. Any kind of aviation tragedy like this requires a lot of forensic work. It becomes more difficult when we're not actively involved on the ground. We are offering full cooperation with the Egyptians, with the Russians and others. But a lot of this is peace work. But there's a possibility that they may have taken place.

STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of the intelligence community seems to think it's more of a probability. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence Committee thinks it is. And he told me last week that this would mean that ISIS has fully eclipsed Al Qaeda as the greatest terror threat in the world. Is that right?

OBAMA: Well, number one, I think it's premature, but it is a possibility. Number two, what we've known for a long time, since the duration of my presidency and before that, is that a small network of people if they've got some skills and bomb making capabilities can carry out some big damage.

And this is why we have ramped up our aviation security not just here in the United States but overseas. If there's a carrier coming here, then we're working with that airlines and that airport to make sure that they've got certain procedures. Now, we don't fly directly over the Sinai to the United States, and as a consequence we don't have those same arrangements at those airports.

Washington, Apr 22 - Next week, the Obama Administration will mark its 100th day in power. The first three-plus months of this Administration have been turbulent, to say the least. Confronted with the most severe economic crisis in generations, President Obama and congressional Democrats have set out on a spending spree the likes of which our nation has never seen. In fact, the Administration has spent more in its first 100 days than all previous presidents have combined – hardly a distinction of which to be proud.



Feeling the heat, the President has asked his Cabinet to begin identifying wasteful programs to cut from the federal budget. While this sort of talk sounds good, the inescapable fact is that the Administration and Congress have spent the last three months piling mountains of wasteful debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren. Just take a look at how some of the so-called “stimulus” dollars are being spent. In spite of promises of transparency and accountability from the Administration, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are being spent on wasteful projects: a skateboard park in Rhode Island, bike racks in the District of Columbia, highway studies instead of construction projects in my native Ohio, and programs led by housing agencies that have repeatedly failed audits – all in the name of economic “stimulus.”

This Sunday marks a day that is symbolic not only of our government’s arrogant culture of spending – but of this Administration’s borrowing binge as well. It’s called “Debt Day.” Many workers have become familiar with a concept known as “Tax Freedom Day,” which is the day on which Americans begin working for themselves each year, after having covered Uncle Sam’s tax bill for the year. Debt Day is very similar. It ","0"

CHENEY: There is no middle ground.

OBAMA: I'm going to spend some time listening.

KARL: But can bipartisanship survive the politics of the moment?

"China's Space Threat: How Missiles Could Target U.S. Satellites
At 5:28 PM EST on Jan. 11, 2007, a satellite arced over southern China. It was small—just 6 ft. long—a tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft.

It was not the start of the world's first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly 18,000 mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat and—boom—obliterated it. ""It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path,"" says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs.

For China, a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable. But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons. ""The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space,"" says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. ""China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress. If we're not careful, space could become the new Wild West. You don't just go and blow things up there."" In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of antiÂ­satellite technol","0"

"'This Week' Transcript: Goolsbee, Brown & Corker
April 25, 2010 — -- TAPPER: Good morning, everyone. Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduled to hold its first vote on the biggest overhaul in decades of the nation's financial system, changes that could impact your savings, your pension, maybe even your job. This as a big Wall Street investment bank comes under attack on Tuesday. Executives from Goldman Sachs, which is already facing government accusations of fraud, will testify before a Senate committee investigating whether the firm profited from the massive housing crash at the expense of its clients.

Joining me this morning, three key players in the middle of this storm. With me here, is Austan Goolsbee from the President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In Chattanooga, we have Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker, and in Cincinnati, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, both key members of the Senate Banking Committee. Gentlemen, welcome.

GOOLSBEE: Thanks for having us.

CORKER: Good morning. Good to be with you.

TAPPER: Before we start with Wall Street reform, I do want to talk about these Goldman Sachs memos, these emails that the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has released, emails that seem to show executives rejoicing as the housing market crashed, and in fact, they seem to contradict the impression given by Goldman Sachs that they lost money as the mortgage related investment crash happened. In a private email, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote in November of 2007, ""Of course we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money, then made more than we lost because of shorts.""

Senator Brown, I want to ask you. What do these emails signify to you?

BROWN: Well, these emails signify that there are all kinds of conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that there are -- that Wall Street, while working for its clients and working against its clients in the same sort of bundled toxic securities, and that's why we need the Volcker rule. That's why we nee","0"

The debate began after ABC's Martha Raddatz and David Muir introduced the candidates.

Raddatz: Good evening to you all. The rules for tonight are very basic and have been agreed to by all three campaigns in advance. Candidates can take up to a minute-and-a-half to respond directly to a question. For a rebuttal, for a follow-up, 45 seconds will be allowed. There are green, yellow, and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is running out and when they're supposed to be finished with their answers.

MUIR: We will be tackling many critical issues right here tonight, and we begin with opening statements, in alphabetical order, and Secretary Clinton.

CLINTON: Well, thank you. And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.

You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top. That's the job. I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.

"SECRET VIDEO: Romney Tells Millionaire Donors What He REALLY Thinks of Obama Voters
During a private fundraiser earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told a small group of wealthy contributors what he truly thinks of all the voters who support President Barack Obama. He dismissed these Americans as freeloaders who pay no taxes, who don’t assume responsibility for their lives, and who think government should take care of them. Fielding a question from a donor about how he could triumph in November, Romney replied:

There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that’s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax.

Romney went on: “[M]y job is is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”

Mother Jones has obtained video of Romney at this intimate fundraiser—where he candidly discussed his campaign strategy and foreign policy ideas in stark terms he does not use in public—and has confirmed its authenticity. To protect the confidential source who provided the video, we have blurred some of the image, and we will not identify the date or location of the event, which occurred after Romney had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. [UPDATE: We can now report that this fundraiser was held at the Boca Raton home of controversial private equity manager Marc Leder on May 17, and we’ve removed the blurring from the video.

"There’s another choice
When it comes to electing their next president, Americans want a candidate to vote for — not just someone to vote against.

American voters want the perspective of an outsider who can bring an entrepreneurial perspective to the White House. They aren’t opposed to experience in governing — so long as it doesn’t bring with it an addiction to crony capitalism and the fruits thereof.

And they want a candidate who looks after American interests and doesn’t use war to destabilize already volatile regions of the world like the Middle East.

I’m running for President to offer that alternative. I am a successful businessman, and grew my construction business to employ more than 1,000 workers.

I was the Republican governor of the heavily Democratic state of New Mexico. I focused on good government and I got it done — just like my running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. The people of New Mexico reelected me by a comfortable margin. Ditto for Weld.

Think of it this way: I’m someone you would trust to run your household and to keep it safe while you went away on a trip or a vacation. I could even fix a few things around the house. After all, the construction company I founded began as a one-man handy-man operation. Can you say the same for Hillary Clinton

I’ve balanced budgets and cut taxes. I’ve also spoken my mind about where the country needed to go on personal freedoms and marriage equality. In 1999, I became the only sitting governor to publicly advocate the legalization of marijuana. Senator Bernie Sanders

I’m also a strong believer in our Constitutional rights to civil liberties and privacy. Our government should not be spying on the electronic communications of American citizens. Nor should our iPhones or Android devices be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures.

And I understand that, as a nation and as a society, we have unfinished business to right the wrongs of injustice suffered by minorities. Blacks are 30 percent more","0"

The Ohio Art Company, a business and community leader for more than 100 years, announced today that it has sold its Etch A Sketch and Doodle Sketch brands in a move designed to allow it to focus on its metal lithography business and invest in its manufacturing operations in Bryan. Ohio Art’s first lithography press was installed in its Bryan, Ohio facility in 1912 and the company has since specialized in precision printing and beautiful color reproduction that is protected to withstand the rigors of stamping and fabrication. The company has been a leader in the metal lithography business for more than a century and company CEO Elena West confirms that, “Ohio Art is squarely focused on continuing to build its reputation as one of the premier metal lithographers in North America.”

The company also underscored its continued commitment to the Bryan, Ohio community and has been working with local business leaders to more effectively utilize its Bryan facility. G&M Media Packaging and Reece Brothers Digital Printers have both signed on as tenants and Wilton Keck Recycling has purchased warehouse space for their upstart commercial recycling business. The company is also leasing warehouse space to two local manufacturers in need of additional staging.

“We are very pleased to be able to partner with these local businesses to provide them with quality space and support services and, most importantly, keep these companies and jobs right here in Bryan,” notes Martin Killgallon, President. “Our commitment to the community is important to our strategy and we look forward to continuing to partner with other local businesses.”

"Transcript of second McCain, Obama debate
NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- Presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama debated in Nashville, Tennessee, on Tuesday night. NBC's Tom Brokaw moderated the debate. Here is a transcript of that debate.

Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain meet in Nashville for their second debate.

Brokaw: Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. I'm Tom Brokaw of NBC News. And welcome to this second presidential debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.

Tonight's debate is the only one with a town hall format. The Gallup Organization chose 80 uncommitted voters from the Nashville area to be here with us tonight. And earlier today, each of them gave me a copy of their question for the candidates.

From all of these questions -- and from tens of thousands submitted online -- I have selected a long list of excellent questions on domestic and foreign policy.

Neither the commission nor the candidates have seen the questions. And although we won't be able to get to all of them tonight, we should have a wide-ranging discussion one month before the election.

Each candidate will have two minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a one-minute follow-up. The audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite, and attentive, no cheering or outbursts. Those of you at home, of course, are not so constrained.

The only exception in the hall is right now, as it is my privilege to introduce the candidates, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.

Gentlemen?

Gentlemen, we want to get under way immediately, if we can. Since you last met at Ole Miss 12 days ago, the world has changed a great deal, and not for the better. We still don't know where the bottom is at this time.

As you might expect, many of the questions that we have from here in the hall tonight and from online have to do with the American economy and, in fact, with global economic conditions.

Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, ""Remember.""

While rightly honored as a true patriot, Senator McCain has opposed tax relief, supported amnesty and is too much of a Washington insider to change Washington.

Announces His Candidacy Washington DC - April 17, 2006 We have a great country. We can do better. We must embrace our Founders intentions that we evolve our democracy to remain true to its founding principles. Lincoln, 140 years ago, defined our government: “of the People, by the People, and for the People.” It falls to us to now give full meaning to a Government “by the People” so our common wisdom is reflected in our national policies. Today’s advances in information and communication technology provide us unprecedented ability to communicate as citizens, and all that is lacking is a political process, a mechanism, that permits the citizens to play a direct role in the operations of government. Our country needs a renewal––renewal not just of particular policies, or of particular people, but of democracy itself. I believe that the remedy for the state of our political alienation is the civic renewal embodied in the “National Initiative for Democracy.” The National Initiative is proposed legislation that colleagues and I have developed over the last fifteen years. The National Initiative––when enacted into law––will bring all American citizens into the operations of government as lawmakers. Our three branches of government have become like an unstable chair with only three legs. The Founders could not have envisioned how much money and special interests would corrupt our political process. Giving us––American citizens––legislative power will put the fourth leg on our chair, giving birth to a new foundation of American governance––adding a new check to our system of Checks and Balances. I believe the internet adage: “all of us together are smarter than any one of us alone. I say: “Let the People Decide.” Lawmaking is the central power of government not Election Day voting.

Republican Presidential Debate

Aired June 05, 2007 - 19:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



WOLF BLITZER, HOST: Let's begin our questioning.

Right now Tom Fahey of the New Hampshire Union Leader with the first question.



TOM FAHEY, NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER: Thanks, Wolf.



Governor Romney, I wanted to start by asking you a question on which every American has formed an opinion.



We have lost 3,400 troops, civilian casualties are even higher, and the Iraqi government does not appear ready to provide for the security of its own country. Knowing everything you know right now, was it a mistake for us to invade Iraq?



MITT ROMNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS: Well, the question is, kind of, a non sequitur, if you will. What I mean by that -- or a null set -- that is that if you're saying let's turn back the clock and Saddam Hussein had opening up his country to IAEA inspectors and they'd come in and they'd found that there were no weapons of mass destruction, had Saddam Hussein therefore not violated United Nations resolutions, we wouldn't be in the conflict we're in.



But he didn't do those things, and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in.



I supported the president's decision based on what we knew at that time.



I think we were underprepared and underplanned for what came after we knocked down Saddam Hussein.



By the way, Harry Reid was wrong. We did not lose the war in Iraq. And that's not the sort of thing you say when you have men and women in harm's way.



We did, however, not do a great job after we knocked down Saddam Hussein and won the war to take him down and his military.



And at this stage, the right thing for us to do is to see if we could possibly stabilize the central government in Iraq so that they can have stability, and so we can bring our troops home as soon as possi","0"

"Pledge of Allegiance E-mail
Pledge of Allegiance E-mail

The following is the text of a chain e-mail that features Sen. John McCain's remarks about the Pledge of Allegiance, and an anecdote from his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.

John McCain's remarks about the Pledge of Allegiance

In light of the recent appeals court ruling in California, with respect to the Pledge of Allegiance, the following recollection from Senator John McCain is very appropriate:

'The Pledge of Allegiance' - by Senator John McCain

'As you may know, I spent five and one half years as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. In the early years of our imprisonme nt, the NVA kept us in solitary confinement or two or three to a cell. In 1971 the NVA moved us from these conditions of isolation into large rooms with as many as 30 to 40 men to a room.

This was, as you can imagine, a wonderful change and was a direct result of the efforts of millions of Americans on behalf of a few hundred POWs 10,000 miles from home.

One of the men who moved into my room was a young man named Mike Christian.

Mike came from a small town near Selma , Alabama . He didn't wear a pair of shoes until he was 13 years old. At 17, he enlisted in the US Navy. He later earned a commission by going to Officer Training School Then h e became a Naval Flight Officer and was shot down and captured in 1967. Mike had a keen and deep appreciation of the opportunities this country and our military provide for people who want to work and want to succeed.

As part of the change in treatment, the Vietnamese allowed some prisoners to receive packages from home. In some of these packages were handkerchiefs, scarves and other items of clothing.

Mike got himself a bamboo needle. Over a period of a couple of months, he created an American flag and sewed on the inside of his shirt.

Every afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's shirt on the wall of t he cell and say the Pledge of Allegiance.

"McCain spoke up early
A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays the Arizona senator as a leader in the fight against global warming.

The ad begins with fast-paced music and horns honking. It shows black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching and a glacier collapsing.

""John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago,"" the narrator says.

The stark black-and-white scenes are replaced by more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam.

""Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.""

Sign up for PolitiFact texts

With images such as a newspaper headline that says ""McCain climate views clash with GOP,"" the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change.

Indeed, the Congressional Record shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.

On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.

When he introduced the bill, McCain called it ""the first comprehensive piece of legislation"" in capping emissions.

""The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.""

By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.

"Ad says Obama apologized, showed weakness on Iran
A new ad from an independent group claims President Barack Obama apologized and showed weakness on Iran.



The ad comes from Secure America Now, which calls itself a ""broad-based grassroots coalition of 2 million national security activists."" A reader in Florida asked us to check it out. It uses clips from an interview Obama gave in the White House during his first days in office with the Arab network Al Arabiya.



A female voiceover says, ""For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology."" (The words ""an apology"" flash across the screen.)



Then it cuts to Obama telling the interviewer, ""Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating.""



The voiceover says, ""He reached out.""



Obama: ""It is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran.""



Voiceover: ""Iran answered with terror, attacks on our troops and nuclear weapons development. …Tell President Obama: no apologies, no weakness. It’s time to stop Iran.""



The claim that Obama has apologized for America has been used and reused countless times -- always falsely -- and we found that this incarnation is only a hair closer to the truth.



His first interview



Obama sat down with Hisham Melhem, Al Arabiya’s Washington bureau chief, on Jan. 27, 2009. The network, based in Dubai, is regarded as a less-radical format than Al Jazeera and has been criticized for having a pro-Saudi Arabia bias.



News coverage at the time billed the interview as Obama’s ""first television interview in the White House,"" according to the New York Times, and ""his first formal television interview as president,"" per the Washington Post. A spokesman for Secure America Now also pointed us to an MSNBC story characterizing the interview as the new president’s first.



The Al Arabiya interview was part of a coordinated unveiling of Obama’s diplomatic initiatives. He had just named former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special ","0"

Go to www.hillaryclinton.com and check out Bill Clinton's syrupy five minute ad for Hillary. He introduces the commercial by saying that he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background. His version of her biography is about as reliable as if it appeared in Pravda!



So, I wanted to make a few corrections:

Bill says: Hillary never wanted to run for public office, but she did want to work at public service.

The true facts are: When Clinton was considering not running for another term as Governor of Arkansas in 1990, Hillary said she would run if he didn't. She and Bill even had me take two surveys to assess her chances of winning. The conclusion was that she couldn't win because people would just see her as a seat warmer for when Bill came back licking his wounds after losing for president. So she didn't run. Bill did and won. But there is no question she had her eye on public office, as opposed to service, long ago.



Bill says: In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.

The true facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.



Bill says: Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids.



The true facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.



Bill says: Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers.

JUDY WOODRUFF: We come back now to the gun story.

And we're joined by David Keene. He's president of the National Rifle Association.

Welcome to the NewsHour.

DAVID KEENE, National Rifle Association: Thank you for having me.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, earlier on the program, we heard from the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, who said the critics who argue that what they're trying to do by limiting gun violence and say that it's an attack on the Second Amendment are not right. He said, what we're simply doing are commonsense safety measures.

DAVID KEENE: That's what Michael Bloomberg says.

No, it is an attack on the Second Amendment. It is an attack on those Americans who purchased and legally use firearms, who have never committed a criminal act, who have never done anything wrong. And they can say that it doesn't infringe upon their rights, but, in fact, it does.

Now, every amendment -- the First Amendment -- you can't, famously, yell fire in a crowded theater. The Second Amendment is also subject to reasonable limits. The Supreme Court has held that. But they're strictly looked at.

And you have to demonstrate that they really impact things and that they're really necessary. And the problem that we have is that none of the things that they have suggested are going to do any good. They're asking the question, Judy, what do we do about guns? The question should be, what do we do to prevent the kinds of things that happened in Connecticut?

And we don't think that they're asking that question, but they're pursuing their own agenda.

"Let’s Not Be Civil - The New York Times
Last week, President Obama offered a spirited defense of his party’s values — in effect, of the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society. Immediately thereafter, as always happens when Democrats take a stand, the civility police came out in force. The president, we were told, was being too partisan; he needs to treat his opponents with respect; he should have lunch with them, and work out a consensus.

That’s a bad idea. Equally important, it’s an undemocratic idea.

Let’s review the story so far.

Two weeks ago, House Republicans released their big budget proposal, selling it to credulous pundits as a statement of necessity, not ideology — a document telling America What Must Be Done.

But it was, in fact, a deeply partisan document, which you might have guessed from the opening sentence: “Where the president has failed, House Republicans will lead.” It hyped the danger of deficits, yet even on its own (not at all credible) accounting, spending cuts were used mainly to pay for tax cuts rather than deficit reduction. The transparent and obvious goal was to use deficit fears to impose a vision of small government and low taxes, especially on the wealthy.

So the House budget proposal revealed a yawning gap between the two parties’ priorities. And it revealed a deep difference in views about how the world works.","0"

"Clinton's Lead Over Trump Shrinks to 3 Points: New NBC News/WSJ Poll
Hillary Clinton's advantage over Donald Trump has narrowed to just three points — resulting in a dead-heat general-election contest with more than five months to go until November, according to a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.

Clinton, who remains a heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, leads the presumptive GOP nominee 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, a difference that is within the poll’s margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. In April, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December.

In a more hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent.

Looking inside the numbers of her race against Trump, Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent) and those ages 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent).

Trump, meanwhile, is ahead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent) and independents (42 percent to 37 percent).

The NBC/WSJ poll — conducted May 15-19 — comes after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but also as the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become more contentious in recent days.

Republicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin, which is up from 72 percent to 13 percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee.

Complete Coverage: Decision 2016

"U.S. Senator John McCain
Washington, DC - Today, U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) spoke on the floor of the United States Senate about the Marriage Protection Amendment. The following is the text of his statement as prepared and submitted for the record: Mr. President, I believe that the institution of marriage can serve its public purposes only when it is understood as being a union between one man and one woman. It is this understanding that offers public reinforcement to the vital and unique roles played by mothers and fathers in the raising of their children. It is this understanding that offers a foundation for principled objections to those who would pursue the imprudent agenda of dismantling an institution that has served us well, and replacing it with newer and more flexible understandings that are of questionable public value. I also believe in the institution of republican government as described in the United States Constitution. This, too, is an institution that has served us well, founded upon the precept that the American people speak through their elected representatives, and these representatives remain at all times answerable and accountable to the people whom they serve. Today, on the question of marriage, we are told by advocates on both sides of the debate that these two institutions, as they are currently understood, cannot be reconciled, and that one or the other must be changed. I do not agree, and thus I do not at this time support the proposed Marriage Protection Amendment. The proposed amendment would establish in our Constitution a permanent resolution of a debate that is currently and properly being resolved in different ways, in fifty different states, by the people's elected representatives. Our system of federalism is not easily separable from our commitment to republican government, because it is driven by the idea that we are best governed when those who represent us live where we live, and share the values that we share.

TOM FAHEY, NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER: Thanks, Wolf.



Governor Romney, I wanted to start by asking you a question on which every American has formed an opinion.



We have lost 3,400 troops, civilian casualties are even higher, and the Iraqi government does not appear ready to provide for the security of its own country. Knowing everything you know right now, was it a mistake for us to invade Iraq?



MITT ROMNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS: Well, the question is, kind of, a non sequitur, if you will. What I mean by that -- or a null set -- that is that if you're saying let's turn back the clock and Saddam Hussein had opening up his country to IAEA inspectors and they'd come in and they'd found that there were no weapons of mass destruction, had Saddam Hussein therefore not violated United Nations resolutions, we wouldn't be in the conflict we're in.



But he didn't do those things, and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in.



I supported the president's decision based on what we knew at that time.



I think we were underprepared and underplanned for what came after we knocked down Saddam Hussein.



By the way, Harry Reid was wrong. We did not lose the war in Iraq. And that's not the sort of thing you say when you have men and women in harm's way.



We did, however, not do a great job after we knocked down Saddam Hussein and won the war to take him down and his military.



And at this stage, the right thing for us to do is to see if we could possibly stabilize the central government in Iraq so that they can have stability, and so we can bring our troops home as soon as possi","0"

BOB SCHIEFFER, MODERATOR

[*] SCHIEFFER: Good evening. And welcome to the third and last presidential debate of 2008, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News.

The rules tonight are simple. The subject is domestic policy. I will divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments.

I will ask a question at the beginning of each segment. Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we'll have a discussion.

I'll encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other. If they do not, I will.

The audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain.

(APPLAUSE)

Gentlemen, welcome.

By now, we've heard all the talking points, so let's try to tell the people tonight some things that they -- they haven't heard. Let's get to it.

Another very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know. Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis.

Senator McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things.

Senator Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs.

I will ask both of you: Why is your plan better than his?

Senator McCain, you go first.

MCCAIN: Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.

And thanks to Hofstra.

"He says universal, but it's no guarantee
Under attack at a recent debate from rival Hillary Clinton on health care, Barack Obama shot back:

""Well, let's talk about health care right now because the fact of the matter is that I do provide universal health care. The only difference between Sen. Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated — forced — them to get health care.""

Before jumping into this fray, it's important to note that when it comes to health care, the two Democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common.

One of the few differences is that Clinton includes a universal mandate. That means that after everything else goes according to plan, individuals will be required by law to purchase insurance. Think of how people are required to buy auto insurance and you get an idea of what that might look like.

Obama's plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as the Clinton and Edwards plans do. That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University.

Sign up for PolitiFact texts

Obama's decision not to include a mandate is a more cautious approach, one Obama says is designed not to penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all the reforms are implemented, people will still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't. Obama's argument is that if you then fine them, you're essentially punishing the poor — and they will still be uninsured. Obama is betting that his plan will get costs low enough that many of the estimated 47-million uninsured will sign up without a mandate, and a mandate will come later.

So is it fair for Obama to call his plan ""universal""? Well, not really. Even if you buy his argument that his plan will create the market conditions to make health care uni","0"

"Topic A: How Can President Obama Regain His Political Footing?
With polls showing that President Obama is losing ground, The Post asked political experts what he could do to regain the initiative. Below are contributions from Scott Keeter, Michael S. Berman, Newt Gingrich, Donna Brazile, Robert J. Blendon, Christine Todd Whitman, Dan Schnur, Ed Rogers, Harold Ford Jr. and Ed Gillespie.

SCOTT KEETER

Director of survey research at Pew Research Center

President Obama had a better honeymoon with the public than either Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. But it's over now. His ratings are approaching his electoral margin.

This summer slump is a product of his own actions and political forces outside his control. Obama campaigned for strong government action on the economy and health care, and most of his voters agreed with this direction. But Obama's efforts to expand the role of government have alienated many of those who did not vote for him but nonetheless gave him high marks when first he took office.

Pew Research's political values survey this spring showed no surge in public demand for more government. Indeed, anti-government sentiment, which had been building for years, was heightened by the financial bailout and stimulus program. Moreover, it was inevitable that Obama eventually would have to take responsibility for the economy, which -- despite a few ""green shoots"" -- remains grim.

The health-care debate has taken a toll on the president's popularity as well as that of his party. Americans remain ambivalent, desiring most of the major elements in the reform proposals but simultaneously worrying about too much government control of health care. Obama can influence whether and how reform passes, and whether it passes at all will affect his approval rating. Democrats in Congress fear that passing an unpopular health care package will be politically costly, but as Clinton's 1994 experience demonstrated, they have good reason to fear that failure on health care cou","0"

Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future.

As a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.



Demonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading ""Putin is our president"" and ""Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!"" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city — essentially protecting it — after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What's more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force.

Now that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the ""interests of Russians"" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it.

I was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as ""Sevastopol"" but makes no mention of ""Ukrainian SSR,"" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region","0"

"McCain Campaigns In Nashville
NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Republican presidential candidate John McCain held a town hall meeting at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium Monday.

The Arizona senator gave a 25-minute stump speech before answering questions from the audience at the former home of the Grand Ole Opry.

Former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and former Sen. Fred Thompson spoke before McCain addressed the crowd at the Nashville landmark.

McCain covered several topics as people rose to their feet to ask questions.

McCain said he hasn't chosen a vice presidential running mate.

""I'm the only Republican in my whole family so you can imagine what hell I get,"" one man told McCain as people applauded. ""But I like you. I'm the only one in my family that likes you.""

Laughter filled the theater.

""Maybe I could meet them sometime,"" McCain after chuckling.

He reportedly likes this interactive style of campaigning because it keeps him on his toes. He never skipped a beat Monday even when challenged by audience members.

McCain reiterated his support for a summer gas tax break for Americans in response to rising fuel prices. He emphasized the need for America to keep troops in Iraq. He also said the nation does not need to negotiate with Iran.

He emphasized differences between his positions and that of chief rival Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. He didn't mention New York Sen. Hillary Clinton until someone in the audience asked him about her.

The Arizona senator attended private fundraisers in Nashville. He will travel to Memphis Tuesday for a private fundraiser.","0"
"H1N1 vaccinations to be offered to Guantanamo Bay detainees
Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon will offer the H1N1 vaccination to detainees at the U.S. facility at Guantanamo Bay, officials there said Friday.

The Pentagon made the decision based on U.S. government assessments that people held in detention facilities are at high risk for the pandemic, said Maj. Diana R. Haynie, a spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay, which is in charge of holding the suspected terrorists.

""Detainees at JTF Guantanamo are considered to be at higher risk and therefore they will be offered the H1N1 vaccination,"" Haynie said.

""JTF Guantanamo conducts safe, humane, legal and transparent care and custody of detainees. As such, we must provide detainees the medical care necessary to maintain their health,"" she said.

But Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, urged the Pentagon to reconsider.

""As long as Americans must wait to receive the vaccine, the detainees in Guantanamo Bay should not be given preferential treatment to receive the H1N1 vaccination,"" Stupak said in a letter to Secretary of the Army John McHugh.

""Until this shortage is addressed, I urge Pentagon officials to reconsider this decision to vaccinate terrorist detainees ahead of Americans who are waiting,"" Stupak said.

Base officials had not received the vaccinations and did not know when they were expected to arrive, Haynie said.

Once the vaccinations are received, doses will be administered to active-duty personnel before being offered to detainees and others on the base, Haynie said.

The vaccination is mandatory for all uniformed personnel, she said.

The vaccinations will be voluntary for the detainees, who will be briefed on the virus and the vaccine before they decide whether to receive the vaccine.

Some of the detainees have already voluntarily taken the seasonal flu shot, Haynie said.","0"
"Inquiry Sought in Hillary Clinton’s Use of Email
The department is now reviewing some 55,000 pages of emails. A first batch of 3,000 pages was made public on June 30.

In the course of the email review, State Department officials determined that some information in the messages should be retroactively classified. In the 3,000 pages that were released, for example, portions of two dozen emails were redacted because they were upgraded to “classified status.” But none of those were marked as classified at the time Mrs. Clinton handled them.

In a second memo to Mr. Kennedy, sent on July 17, the inspectors general said that at least one email made public by the State Department contained classified information. The inspectors general did not identify the email or reveal its substance.

The memos were provided to The New York Times by a senior government official.

The inspectors general also criticized the State Department for its handling of sensitive information, particularly its reliance on retired senior Foreign Service officers to decide if information should be classified, and for not consulting with the intelligence agencies about its determinations.

In March, Mrs. Clinton insisted that she was careful in her handling of information on her private account. “I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email,” she said. “There is no classified material. So I’m certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.”","0"

In part five of the second democratic primary debate, things get personal as the candidates touch on the Black Lives Matter movement, Hillary Clinton's email scandal and Bernie Sanders' ability to win over conservatives

In part five of the second democratic primary debate, things get personal as the candidates touch on the Black Lives Matter movement, Hillary Clinton's email scandal and Bernie Sanders' ability to win over conservatives

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned laughter and applause during Saturday's Democratic debate for a line defending his progressive tax policy.

When asked how he would pay for proposals like tuition-free college for Americans, Sanders said he would finance them by ""due-demanding: that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations - have gotten away with murder for years - start paying their fair share.""

CBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes pressed the White House hopeful: ""Let's get specific. How high would you go? You've said before you'd go above 50 percent. How high?""

""We haven't come up with an exact number yet,"" Sanders responded. ""But it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower which was 90 percent.""

As an aside, he said, to loud cheers in the audience: ""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.""

Sanders went on to say that his administration would ""end the absurdities as Warren Buffet often reminds us - that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses, or truck drivers that makes no sense at all. There has to be real tax reform and the wealthiest and the large corporations will pay when I'm president.""

In fact, during the first term of Republican President Eisenhower, the marginal tax rate on regular income for those earning over $400,000 -- at the time, the highest income bracket -- was 92 percent. The tax rate was carried over from Democratic President Harry Truman's adm","0"

Oct. 11: The debate over the best way forward intensifies in Washington. Two key voices on the Hill and two experienced military leaders weigh in on the direction a new war strategy should take: Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI); Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC); Gen. Barry McCaffrey (Ret.); and Gen. Richard Myers (Ret.). Plus a roundtable: Ron Brownstein, Paul Gigot, Katty Kay, Bob Woodward.

GREGORY: Realistically, from both of you generals, what is victory in Afghanistan?

GEN. MYERS: Some sort--in my view, it's some sort of stable government. And back to Senator Levin's point...

GREGORY: So we can't leave. We can't pull troops out of Afghanistan until there's a stable government?

GEN. MYERS: I think it has to be a viable, stable government that the people believe in. And if you're going to have Afghan security forces that are effective, they have to be connected to the central government and feel that there's some connection and some direction coming from their central government. Otherwise it doesn't work; they're just in the field doing what they do but there's no connection to the overall mission of that country. So I think clearly that's, that's part of it. And I think there has to be some economic development to give people there hope that there's something beyond...

GREGORY: Can we beat the Taliban?

GEN. McCAFFREY: Well, I, I think in 10 years of $5 billion a month and with a significant front-end security component, we can leave a Afghan national army and police force and a viable government and roads and universities. But it's a time constraint that we can't change things in 18 to 24 months. So I think we got to lower expectations. Senator Levin talked about our political resolve; is it there or not?

Fact Check: Hillary’s Iowa Remarks

After months of character attacks from her opponents, Hillary responded with the facts. The following is a rundown of some of the contrasts that Hillary highlighted in her speech today in Iowa:

Hillary: “A couple of my leading opponents, directly and through surrogates, have spent months criticizing me without having to answer any of their own questions. They’ve been attacking my character. As I have said repeatedly, I prefer to attack the problems of the country and let my opponents run their own campaigns.”

Sen. Obama attacked Hillary. [Fact Hub, 12/3/07]

Sen. Edwards criticized Hillary for using doubletalk in the debate. ""The Democratic debate on Tuesday was a defining moment in this election. From my perspective it is important for the next president of the United States to be honest and sincere and trust-worthy given what's happened with Bush over the last seven years. Instead of straight talk, there was a lot of doubletalk in the debate from Senator Clinton on some of the most important issues facing the American people."" [Edwards Statement, 11/3/07]

Hillary: “When it comes to health care, one of my opponents believes it’s acceptable to leave out 15 million Americans. That would be 100,000 here in Iowa. Leave them out from his health care plan because universal coverage might be too hard to achieve. I disagree. I don’t think we should start by giving up on 15 million Americans. That’s why my health care plan covers everyone.”

Sen. Obama’s health care plan would leave 15 million uninsured. [Fact Hub, 11/19/07]

Hillary: “When it comes to social security, one of my opponents uses the Republican talking points and has been open to raising the retirement age and cutting benefits. Now he says he is for lifting the payroll tax, which would be a trillion dollar tax increase. Again, I disagree. I don’t think we should fix Social Security on the backs of our seniors and the middle class. I have always fought for Soc","0"

The following is a transcript of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr’s remarks after being introduced as Senator Barack Obama’s vice-presidential running mate in Springfield, Ill., as recorded by CQ Transcriptions:

Well, it's great to be here! On the steps of the old State House in the land of Lincoln. President Lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place. Then stand firm. Today, Springfield, I know my feet are in the right place. And I am proud to stand firm for the next president of the United States of America, Barack Obama. Folks, Barack and I come from very different places, but we share a common story. An American story. He was the son of a single mom, a single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids. But she raised him. She raised him to believe in America. to believe that in this country there is no obstacle that could keep you from your dreams. If you are willing to work hard and fight for it. I was different. I was an Irish-Catholic kid from Scranton with a father who like many of yours in tough economic times fell on hard times, but my mom and dad raised me to believe, it's a saying Barack you heard me say before, my dad repeated it and repeated it. Said champ, it's not how many times you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up. It's how quickly you get up. Ladies and gentlemen, that's your story. That's America's story. It's about if you get up, you can make it.

That's the America Barack Obama and I believe in. That's the American dream. And ladies and gentlemen, is there no ordinary times, and this is no ordinary election.

"Obama’s Remarks at the White House Health Care Forum
We can all agree that if we want to bring down skyrocketing costs, we'll need to modernize our system and invest in prevention. We can agree that if we want greater accountability and responsibility, we have to ensure that people aren't overcharged for prescription drugs, or discriminated against for pre-existing conditions -- and we need to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse in government programs. I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken. So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive.

And finally, we can all agree that if we want to translate these goals into policies, we need a process that is as transparent and inclusive as possible. And that's why I've asked all of you -- representatives of organizations, interests, and parties from across the spectrum -- to join us here today. In fact, this was the hottest ticket in town. (Laughter.) That's why we asked concerned citizens like the folks on this stage to organize open meetings across America where people could air their views. As Travis said, more than 3,000 meetings were held in all 50 states and D.C.; more than 30,000 people attended. I thank them for their input and their ideas, and look forward to reading the report that Travis has presented to me.

In this effort, every voice has to be heard. Every idea must be considered. Every option must be on the table. There should be no sacred cows. Each of us must accept that none of us will get everything that we want, and that no proposal for reform will be perfect. If that's the measure, we will never get anything done. But when it comes to addressing our health care challenge, we can no longer let the perfect be the enemy of the essential. And I don'","0"

"RACE FOR CITY HALL: The Republican Candidate; A Mercurial Mayor's Confident Journey
There he is in the photos, aflame with conviction and heady with success: class president, editor on the law review, bold young prosecutor, No. 3 man at the Justice Department, crime-fighting United States Attorney, archenemy of the Mafia, the 107th Mayor of the City of New York. Quite a run!

And now, working from City Hall, Rudolph William Giuliani, 53, has become New York's one ubiquitous figure, hurrying from a burned-out building to a subway derailment to the bedside of a wounded police officer. He is Gotham's action hero, self-cast as the take-charge guy who is reliably among the first at every scene.

By most reckonings, including those of many adversaries, Mr. Giuliani has coupled this celebrity with effective leadership. A seemingly ungovernable city now seems responsive to discipline, its crime rate in a plunge, its tourist-stocked streets palpably safer.

Still, however many his accomplishments, there is something else striking about the Mayor: his temperament. He seems to believe in mayoral infallibility, at least so long as he is the Mayor. To question his righteousness is to risk his wrath. A devil's advocate often seems regarded as the devil himself.","0"
"Encounters With 'Regular Guy' Fred Thompson -- New York Magazine
Photo: Preston Gannaway/Concord Monitor/Polaris (Thompson); Getty Images (The White House)

Fred Thompson is laying on the southern-fried charm. It’s a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law & Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. “I’m just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm,” he says as he plows toward the ballroom.

Inside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson’s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable woman—a former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband’s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.

The room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson script—a bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. “I was telling one of my buddies up there, ‘You know, it’s kind of strange.

"Obamacare vs. the Catholic bishops
I recently completed a very short interview on Vatican Radio to discuss the current battle between the Obama administration and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. It didn’t permit me to say more than that the Obama administration is making a political mistake, so I’d like to say a bit more about the serious consequences that will likely result and how we ended up with this Church-State conundrum in the first place.

As Dr. Donald Condit has already explained, the Obama administration seems to be making a political calculation that this controversy will blow over before the November’s presidential election, because the conscience exemption for providing and paying for abortion, sterilization, and contraception will not take effect until later next year. But the miscalculation was predictable and is now evident, with not only Catholics, but Orthodox, evangelical, Jewish and other religious leaders taking a stand. Unless the administration relents or the Obamacare law is ruled unconstitutional, Catholic hospitals and other institutions will be faced with a choice between not providing insurance coverage to their employees – and thereby being fined by the government – or pay for the provision of services that they believe are morally evil.

A journalist friend in Rome just raised an alternative reading of the story to me on the street. What if Obama is actually making a principled argument that abortion, sterilization, and contraception services are a fundamental aspect of women’s health that cannot and should not be denied to anyone, regardless of their own religious or individual convictions? Perhaps the White House believes, as most progressives do, that these stodgy, uptight opponents will eventually, inevitably, be overcome, and we will one day wonder what all the fuss about. If so, the administration is doing much more than thinking about the next election; it’s redefining what the word “health” means to include me","0"

"Teamsters Tout ANWR on Capitol Hill
A vote for exploration of Alaska's National Wildlife Reserve (ANWR) is a vote for environmental responsibility, Jerry Hood, a Teamsters leader from Alaska, said during a Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday, July 31, 2001.

""We know it can be done safely,"" said Hood, who is Special Advisor for Energy Policy to Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa. Hood is also Secretary-Treasurer of Local 959 in Anchorage.

Hood noted that 58 percent of the petroleum used by the United States is imported, and that figure will jump to 70 percent by 2010. Hood said the imported oil arrives in largely unsafe, single-hull oil tankers. Hood recalled the 1989 Exxon Valdez tragedy in Alaska.

""We never want to see that again,"" Hood said. Exploring for oil in Alaska will make the United States less dependent on imports, he said.

The Teamsters Union supports the creation of 735,000 good-paying jobs for working families that would result from opening ANWR. Hood said he is confident the House of Representatives will vote to approve ANWR oil exploration. The House is scheduled to begin debate Wednesday, August 1, and a vote is expected by Thursday, August 2.

Hood was joined at the news conference by Reps. Tom Delay, (R-Texas), J.C. Watts (R-OK) and Roy Blunt (R-MO). U.S. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao also spoke.

Today, John McCain Outlined A New Comprehensive Strategy For Victory In Afghanistan. The status quo in Afghanistan is unacceptable, and from the moment the next President walks into the Oval Office, he will face critical decisions about Afghanistan. John McCain Is Calling For A New Strategy In Afghanistan That Applies The Tried And True Principles Of Counter-Insurgency Used In The Iraq Surge. As President, John McCain will turn around the war in Afghanistan with a comprehensive strategy for victory. In Afghanistan, we need an integrated, nationwide civil-military campaign that is focused on providing security for the population. John McCain's Comprehensive Strategy For Victory In Afghanistan: John McCain Will Work With Our Allies To Ensure Unity Of Command In Afghanistan. One of the reasons there is no comprehensive campaign plan for Afghanistan is because there is no unity of command. Today, there are no less than three different American military combatant commands operating in Afghanistan, as well as NATO. The top commander in Afghanistan needs to be just that: the supreme commander of all coalition forces operating a successful counter-insurgency strategy that integrates all instructs of our national power. John McCain Will Appoint An Afghanistan Czar To Ensure Commanders Have What They Need To Win. Unity of command is a principle lacking in Washington. Too often, even as our soldiers and diplomats cooperate in the field, their superiors back home have been squabbling. Last year, the Administration took a step in the right direction and appointed a war czar. But the situation in Afghanistan demands a separate Czar based in the White House, reporting directly to the President and dedicated to the sole mission of ensuring we bring the war in Afghanistan to a successful end.

I'm going to turn it over to Robert Gibbs now.

MR. GIBBS: Thanks, everybody, for joining. We're going to do this basically in two parts. The first part, my colleagues will go through the GM specific parts of the call tonight. And then after that we will go through the government ownership principles, which I know a number of you are interested in as part of this and other transactions.

So with that, I'm going to turn it over to my colleague.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, I'll just try to run through this reasonably quickly and maximize the time for questions. Everyone should have a fact sheet. I know you've only had it for a short period of time, so let me run through quickly the main points that we wanted to cover.

Everyone is aware that 60 days ago the President announced that he would give General Motors 60 days in order to design a plan for viability that would achieve lasting and permanent profitability and opportunity for success. And since that time the company has been working diligently in conjunction with the auto task force to implement those principles, including one of the President's main principles which was the concept of shared sacrifice among all of the stakeholders.

And so we are here tonight to give you a preview of the results of this, including what the President will talk about tomorrow. So I'll r","0"

Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. ""First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states.

Writers May Have Pact. Huckabee Crosses Picket Line—Again

by Mike Hall, Feb 8, 2008

Television and movie writers who have been on strike since Nov. 5 will meet tomorrow in New York City and Los Angeles to discuss a potential tentative agreement that could end the strike. The Writers Guild of America members have been fighting to win a fair share of revenue for their work distributed online, through DVDs and other new media.

Also on the strike front, Republican presidential candidate and former Gov. Mike Huckabee (Ark.) crossed another picket line (See below.).

Officials of the Writers Guild of America, East ( WGAE), Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) have been meeting informally since Jan. 24, the first meetings between the two sides since the producers walked out of negotiations in December.

In a letter to their members posted on both unions’ websites today, WGAE President Michael Winship and WGAW President Patric Verrone say:

We are continuing to negotiate the terms of a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. We anticipate that we will be able to present the terms of that agreement to you in the next few days. In order to have a full discussion with you of the terms and how they were reached, and in order to get your input before making recommendations or decisions, we have scheduled membership meetings for current-active members only for this Sat., February 9, in New York and Los Angeles.

We urge you to attend. We have gotten to this point in our negotiation as the direct result of the power of this strike, which each of you has generated. Neither the Negotiating Committee, nor the East Council or the West Board, will take action on any contract until after the membership meetings are held and your voices have been heard. We are all in this together.

Transcript below:



MIKA BRZEZINSKI: With us now Republican Representative from Indiana and Chairman of the House Republican Conference, Congressman Mike Pence. He's also Chairman of the American Energy Solutions Group which will introduce the House GOP's answer to the nation's energy problem in a bill later today. Morning Joe has an exclusive look at the details.



JOE SCARBOROUGH: I want to ask him a question.



BRZEZINSKI: Okay, fine.



SCARBOROUGH: I laughed this morning when I heard the President talking about fiscal responsibility. I support PAYGO and I'm sure you support PAYGO but as Dylan Ratigan said, ""the cow is already out of the barn.""



REP. MIKE PENCE: Well, that's right, Joe. I really do believe there is a little bit of symmetry here between the issue of PAYGO and the energy legislation that Republicans are going to be introducing today. What the Democrats have and are planning to bring to the floor this month is essentially a national energy tax. This so-called ""cap and trade bill"" is a means of paying for all of the runaway federal spending that we've seen under the last Administration and redoubled and increased.



SCARBOROUGH: Can you explain that because we hear about cap in trade. Break it down for us as simply as you can. What does that mean for americans and their energy problem?



REP. PENCE: What it means all in the name of climate change this new regime of limiting carbon emissions from all different sources of energy production in this country but i don't think you need to look any further than the President himself, Joe, who literally said his cap and trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, ""necessarily skyrocket"".

"Switchboard, from NRDC :: Barbara Finamore's Blog :: China’s Carbon Intensity Target
China yesterday announced that Premier Wen Jiabao will attend the Copenhagen climate summit and that he will bring with him a target for China of reducing carbon intensity by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. Coming a day after the announcement across the Pacific that President Obama will attend the beginning of the summit, bringing a commitment to reduce U.S. emissions ""in the range of 17%"" from 2005 levels by 2020, this means that we now know what the world's two largest emitters will be bringing to the table when the world's countries gather in Copenhagen.

The official announcement (in Chinese here) notes that on November 25, Premier Wen Jiabao and the State Council standing committee met and decided upon the 2020 target and corresponding measures to achieve it. Of note are the following points:

1.) What exactly does the carbon intensity target cover? China will reduce its carbon intensity, the CO2 emitted per unit GDP, by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. This carbon intensity target will measure only the CO2 emissions from energy consumption and industrial activity, the source of most of China's emissions, and does not take into account efforts to reduce emissions or increase sinks from land use and forestry. This makes sense given that estimating emissions from land use and forestry is less precise than measuring emissions from fuel combustion and industrial activity, both of which are also more tightly linked to GDP than land use and forestry.

"Palin: Pioneer, maverick -- and now game-changer
(CNN) -- The McCain campaign calls her a ""tough executive who has demonstrated"" readiness to be president. The Republican National Committee calls her a ""conservative star with the talent, energy and family support necessary to carry out common sense policies.""

John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate came as a surprise. more photos »

But the Obama campaign calls her a candidate with ""the thinnest foreign policy experience in history"" who is ""currently under investigation in her own state."" And one of the Senate's top Democrats, Charles Schumer, said that although she is ""a fine person, her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling.""

What do we know about Sarah Palin, the 44-year-old first-ever female governor of Alaska, wife and mother of five, and now GOP vice presidential nominee?

On August 29, a new part of her identity dominated the political scene: game-changer.

She entered an already historic election, knowing well two of the biggest things McCain needs her to do: shore up votes among social conservatives and win over disaffected Hillary Clinton-supporting Democrats, many of them women. iReport.com: What do you think of McCain's choice of Palin?

Before catapulting to the forefront of U.S. politics, Sarah Palin was, at points along her journey, a beauty queen, high school basketball star and TV sportscaster. More recently, she became known in Alaska as a popular maverick, staunchly conservative on key issues but vocal about problems she saw, including those in her own party. Watch how conservatives say they're thrilled with Palin »

She got the nickname ""Sarah Barracuda"" for her fierce competitiveness on the basketball court in high school.

"Why the Public Option Isn't the Only Answer to Health-Care Reform
A dangerous sentiment on the left threatens to derail what could be the biggest progressive achievement in half a century. It's the view that any health-care reform that doesn't include a public option isn't ""real"" reform and thus isn't worth doing. This mantra has become an article of faith among many Democrats who haven't necessarily thought through the matter but who take their cues from leaders advancing this argument. Unless liberals rethink this premise, and fast, Democrats will squander their best chance in a generation to end the scandal of the uninsured, bring health security to every American family and begin the long-term process of getting national health costs under control.

The first fallacy of the ""public option or nothing"" mantra is the notion that we'll never cover everyone without a Medicare-style program for Americans under 65. The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this isn't the case. Both have pioneered market-based universal health care. Both cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost -- 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland, compared with 17 percent in the United States, where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured.

Those countries also boast better health outcomes than we do, even when compared to states with similar demographics, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts. Sick people in both countries are pursued as customers by private insurers (rather than shunned, as they are in the United States) because health plans are paid more for sick enrollees via a government-designed system of ""risk adjustment."" The Swiss and Dutch achievements are important because conservative critics often act as though fully socialized systems, such as those in Britain and Canada, are the inevitable result of any drive for universal coverage. In fact, as these two countries show, it i","0"

One out of every four Pennsylvania households is affected by addiction. More than 2,400 Pennsylvanians died from overdoses last year, making it the leading cause of accidental death in our Commonwealth.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms. More than 4 million Americans abuse prescription drugs or painkillers; another 435,000 use heroin.

These facts are shocking, but they reflect the reality right here in our neighborhoods, in Reading, in Lancaster City, and across Pennsylvania. It is happening to Democrats and Republicans, to people of every race and religion. It happens to our friends, family members, and neighbors. We all know them. And we share their pain.

No one suffers alone. We don’t have the option to think of this as merely a private or personal issue. Every addict comes from a family, and has people who love them and suffer with them. It can be almost unbearable to watch someone you love endure the physical and mental effects of drug abuse. Every addiction hurts not only an addict, but an entire community.

All of us pay the price of addiction, too, because it keeps people from fulfilling their potential and contributing more fully to our society. Drug abuse contributes to unemployment, homelessness, and sex trafficking. It puts pressure on government programs and budgets.

Ninety percent of addicts who need treatment don’t get it. Our health care system is failing not only them, but it is failing all of us. Addiction is treatable. We need to treat it, and we need to educate our young people properly in order to prevent the spread of addiction.

At a time when political acrimony is reaching a record level, leaders in both parties are coming together to find solutions. At the state level, Governor Wolf has","0"
"Congressman Allen West : Final Weekly Wrapup
Dear Patriot,

Greetings to our constituents, fellow Floridians, and indeed all Americans, it is time to prepare our weekly update for dissemination.

Today is the 71st Anniversary of the attack on US Naval Base, Pearl Harbor which truly marked our entry into World War II. I can still remember my dad sharing with me his feeling when he heard about this attack on the radio. Of course, he would go forth and serve in the US Army during World War II in the European Theater of Operations (ETO).

Little did my dad realize at the time, that he was beginning a legacy of service to our nation that has now spanned four generations. My dad was a member of that “Greatest Generation” and today his grandson, my nephew, carries that honor to this day.

As with the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, America has, and always will, produce the caliber of men and women who stand as guardians for our nation’s honor. These are men and women who have answered the call then and continue to do so now.

Tomorrow many in our nation will watch the next generation of these men and women as “America’s Football Game” takes place, Army vs. Navy. I wonder how many of these young men and women have relatives who were at Pearl Harbor, or served in World War II?

I am proud to know that my own godson, Midshipman John Melvin Hendricks (that rascal who joined the Navy) will be taking that field tomorrow, his second year.

So as we remember Pearl Harbor today, let us never forget those who will stand and answer the call to arms to protect this Republic, yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

And in speaking of those who serve, I was angered by the developments this week surrounding Army Major Nidal Hasan who three years ago shot 43 soldiers and Department of the Army Civilians, killing 13. An Army appellate court decision removed the current assigned judge from the case citing that he was not impartial. Furthermore, the court backed the assertion that Major Hasan did not ha","0"
"United States Senator Jim DeMint
A day after the Senate adjourned for Easter recess President Obama said he was going to appoint 15 of his nominees during the break, depriving the Senate the opportunity to vet and vote on any of them.



Circumventing constitutional Senate vetting is dangerous because President Obama’s track record in vetting nominees and other high-level appointees has been very poor. At least 10 of them have already resigned or withdrawn in disgrace.



Just yesterday, Maj. Gen. Robert A. Harding withdrew his nomination to become the director of the Transportation Security Administration after it was discovered he claimed “service disabled veteran” status for sleep apnea. President Obama’s first nominee for that position, Erroll Southers, withdrew after refusing to respond to requests relating to false testimony he gave to Congress and his censure by the FBI for improperly accessing files.



Many of the people President Obama is granting recess appointments will hold high level positions that will greatly influence job creation in this country.



One of them, Craig Becker, is a former super lawyer for the AFL-CIO and Service Employees International Union.



Becker supports union-friendly, job-killing “card check” legislation to eliminate the secret ballot requirement to organize a workplace. Now, President Obama is installing him into a position to do it administratively, as Mr. Becker has advocated doing in the past.



This is being done over the will of the Senate. On February 9, on a bipartisan vote the Senate rejected Becker’s nomination to the 5-member National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Democrat Senator Ben Nelson (D-Nebraska) said at the time that Mr. Becker, ""would take an aggressive personal agenda to the NLRB, and that he would pursue a personal agenda there."" Moreover, all 41 Republican senators wrote President Obama a letter earlier this week asking him not to overturn this vote and give Becker a recess appointment.

"9/11 families, others rally in favor of NYC mosque
NEW YORK – The planned mosque and Islamic center blocks from ground zero got a new boost Wednesday from a coalition of supporters that includes families of Sept. 11 victims.

New York Neighbors for American Values rallied for the first time at a municipal building near ground zero.

""I lost a 23-year-old son, a paramedic who gave his life saving Americans and their values,"" Talat Hamdani said, and supporting the Islamic center and mosque ""has nothing to do with religion. It has to do with standing up for our human rights, including freedom of religion.""

Among the nearly 2,800 people killed when the World Trade Center was attacked in 2001 were more than 30 Muslims, she noted.

Opponents of the Islamic center project argue it's insensitive to the families and memories of Sept. 11 victims to build a mosque so close. Supporters cite freedom of religion.

The new coalition was started by members of 40 civic and religious organizations that ""spontaneously called each other, because we had the feeling that something very negative was happening,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of the New York office of the watchdog group Common Cause.

The controversy was triggered by ""irresponsible politicians"" using it as an election issue, she said. Names mentioned at the rally included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, and the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Gingrich has suggested that building the mosque near ground zero is akin to putting a Nazi sign ""next to the Holocaust Museum."" Reid has broken ranks with President Barack Obama by saying he thinks the mosque should be built elsewhere.

Coalition members are now contacting officials, asking them to support the project as a reflection of religious freedom and diversity, and the rejection of ""crude stereotypes meant to frighten and divide us.""

I will ask a question at the beginning of each segment. Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we'll have a discussion.

I'll encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other. If they do not, I will.

The audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain.

Gentlemen, welcome.

By now, we've heard all the talking points, so let's try to tell the people tonight some things that they -- they haven't heard. Let's get to it.

Another very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know. Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis.

Sen. McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things.

Sen. Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs.

I will ask both of you: Why is your plan better than his?

Sen. McCain, you go first.

And thanks to Hofstra.

And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.

Jim, the crowd pretty excited there, as they should be.



JIM ACOSTA, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf. This is a very pumped up crowd. It's also a very big crowd. You know, we talked over the last couple of weeks that this campaign that Mitt Romney has at times had trouble drawing large crowds. That is not the case tonight.

"Earmark reform? 2009 spending bill contains 9,000 of them
WASHINGTON — During the 2008 presidential campaign, candidates Barack Obama and John McCain fought vigorously over who would be toughest on congressional earmarks.

""We need earmark reform,"" Obama said in September during a presidential debate in Oxford, Miss. ""And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.""

President Barack Obama should prepare to carve out a lot of free time and keep the coffee hot this week as Congress prepares to unveil a $410 billion omnibus spending bill that's riddled with thousands of earmarks, despite his calls for restraint and efforts on Capitol Hill to curtail the practice.

The bill will contain about 9,000 earmarks totaling $5 billion, congressional officials say. Many of the earmarks — loosely defined as local projects inserted by members of Congress — were inserted last year as the spending bills worked their way through various committees.

So while Obama and McCain were slamming earmarks on the campaign trail, House and Senate members — Democrats and Republicans — were slapping them into spending bills.

""It will be a little embarrassing for the president if he signs a bill with that many earmarks on it,"" said Stan Collender, a veteran Washington budget analyst. ""He'll say they're left over from the Bush years, and he as to say that next year the bill will be clean.""

Experts agree that most earmarks are legitimate. Cary Leahey, senior economist with Decision Economics in New York, said the nation's economic crisis is a contributing factor to the plethora of earmarks. Lawmakers can argue that for a relatively small price they've helped boost the economy.

""One congressman's earmark is another legislative way to fix a serious problem in his district,"" Leahey said.

Kenneth Thomas, a lecturer in finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of business, agrees.

"Leonard Lance claims federal tax code contains 4 million words, is 7 times as long as Bible
The U.S. Internal Revenue code may make War and Peace read like a novella.

That’s how onerous and confounding the nation’s tax code is, according to Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th), who issued a news release April 15 calling for ""meaningful tax reform"" and blasting the complexity of the tax code.

""The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news,"" Lance said in the news release.

But not all the news is bad for Lance.

Let’s first review the size of the tax code and then compare that with the size of the Bible.

Sign up for PolitiFact texts

A 2010 report by the Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer’s Advocate Office found that the tax code contained 3.8 million words. That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Word’s word-count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at ‘about 4 million.’

We also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million. CCH is a Wolters Kluwer business.

So Lance’s claim about the number of words is generally accurate.

Next, let’s look at number of pages. Lance said 5,600, based on the same figure cited by articles in the Washington Post, the Harvard Business Review and other publications, according to Todd Mitchell, Lance’s chief of staff.

Mark Luscombe, a principal federal tax analyst for CCH, said the publisher’s version of the tax code is 5,036 pages.

""Private publishers do a print version of the Internal Revenue code, but then you’re looking at one private publisher’s version of the code,"" he said. ""We do it in two volumes and we keep condensing it.""

"TSA: Frequently Asked Questions
Frequently Asked Questions

Advanced Imaging Technology

Q. What is advanced imaging technology?

A. Advanced imaging technology safely screens passengers for both metallic and non-metallic threats, including weapons and explosives, which may be concealed under a passengers’ clothing without physical contact to keep the traveling public secure.

Q. Does imaging technology work?

A. Yes. Imaging technology is a highly effective security tool, which can detect both metallic and non-metallic items that may pose a threat to aviation security. AIT is a proven technology and TSA is highly confident in its detection capability.

Q. Is imaging technology optional?

A. Yes, imaging technology screening is optional for all passengers. Passengers who do not wish to receive imagining technology screening will receive alternative screening, including a physical pat-down.

Q. Is imaging technology safe?

A. Advanced imaging technology is safe and meets national health and safety standards. Backscatter technology was evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). For comparison, a single scan using backscatter technology produces exposure equivalent to two minutes of flying on an airplane, and the energy projected by millimeter wave technology is thousands of times less than a cell phone transmission.

Q. What has TSA done to protect my privacy?

A. TSA has implemented strict measures to protect passenger privacy, which is ensured through the anonymity of the image. A remotely located officer views the image and does not see the passenger, and the officer assisting the passenger cannot view the image. The image cannot be stored, transmitted or printed, and is deleted immediately once viewed. Additionally, there is a privacy algorithm applied to blur the image.

SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, thank you.

And I am just delighted to be back here in Austin. You know, nearly 36 years ago I came to Austin for my very first political job, and that was registering voters in south Texas. And I had the great privilege of living for a while in Austin and in San Antonio, and meeting people and making friends that have stayed with me for a lifetime.

And I found that we had a lot in common, a lot of shared values, a belief that hard work is important, that self-reliance and individual responsibility count for a lot.

"New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal
""Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are undocumented aliens,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair.""

The politics of immigration is different in New York. Immigration and burden are two words that do not appear often -- or without raising a furor -- in the same sentence. Whatever their legal status, immigrants are considered a fact of life, a point of pride and an integral part of New York City's identity. Many New Yorkers know well that their own forebears arrived without papers.

""So many of the Irish, so many of the Italians who came when my parents came, were technically illegal,"" Mr. Cuomo said.

Because of New York City's size, new immigrants are absorbed without as much fuss as elsewhere. Often, they are responsible for revitalizing dying neighborhoods -- like Crown Heights in Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens -- and New Yorkers know it.

Illegal immigrants in New York City confound the national stereotype of a young Mexican man sneaking across the border. Italians are the largest group, followed by Ecuadoreans, Poles, Dominicans and Trinidadians. European, Caribbean, Latin American and Asian, they blend into the city without radically altering its racial and ethnic makeup. So the racism that often compounds anti-immigrant sentiment is not as stark in New York.","0"
"A Senate in the Gun Lobby’s Grip - The New York Times
WASHINGTON

SENATORS say they fear the N.R.A. and the gun lobby. But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets. The fear that those children who survived the massacre must feel every time they remember their teachers stacking them into closets and bathrooms, whispering that they loved them, so that love would be the last thing the students heard if the gunman found them.

On Wednesday, a minority of senators gave into fear and blocked common-sense legislation that would have made it harder for criminals and people with dangerous mental illnesses to get hold of deadly firearms — a bill that could prevent future tragedies like those in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., and too many communities to count.

Some of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died. These senators have heard from their constituents — who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them.

I watch TV and read the papers like everyone else. We know what we’re going to hear: vague platitudes like “tough vote” and “complicated issue.” I was elected six times to represent southern Arizona, in the State Legislature and then in Congress. I know what a complicated issue is; I know what it feels like to take a tough vote. This was neither. These senators made their decision based on political fear and on cold calculations about the money of special interests like the National Rifle Association, which in","0"

It's true.

It turns out that one reason why Estonia has been the lone feel-good story amidst the Eurozone crisis is that its tax filing system is scarily efficient.

Introduced in 2000, the system allows individual income taxes, business taxes and excises to be filed electronically.

Using a secure ID, a filer simply completes pre-made forms and approves the document with a digital signature.

The process takes an average of five minutes, and last year 94% of tax declarations were filed electronically.

The system is part of the country's impressive e-government initiative, which allows Estonians to do everything from vote to fill out prescriptions to look up school grades online.

Estonians begin filing their taxes on Wednesday.","0"

PWNED: House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress

Democrats Innovate by Finding New Places to Ignore the Will of the America People



Washington, Jan 22 - The conventional wisdom is being turned upside down as House Republicans demonstrate an unmatched ability to connect with the American people on the Internet’s most popular communities. Once considered the party of online innovation, new research and a host of media reports show that Democrats are largely ignoring some of the most popular social media communities on the web. Recent data shows that nearly 50 percent of adults are active on social networks, nearly two-thirds watch online videos on sites such as YouTube, while over seven million people have joined the fastest-growing online member community, Twitter. Apparently no one has faxed that data to congressional Democrats, however, as the vast majority has yet to incorporate many of these popular technologies into their day-to-day communications. Meanwhile, House Republicans, seeing a unique opportunity to communicate directly with the American people without the traditional media filters of the past, are busy forging new connections with their constituents online. A recently-released report, Twongress: The Power of Twitter in Congress shows us the most glaring example of this party disparity:



“More Republicans Use Twitter Than Democrats - In Congress, there are 132 members who are using Twitter actively: 89 Republicans and 43 Democrats..in the House, there are 75 Republicans using Twitter (42.13 percent of the Republican Caucus) and 32 Democrats (12.45 percent of the Democratic Caucus).""

But Twitter isn’t the only online community dominated by Republicans. Even as they find themselves in a 40 seat minority, House Republicans’ videos consistently outperform those of their counterparts on YouTube. The below chart, provided by industry analyst TubeMogul, illustrates","0"

We will do everything we can to make it enforceable, which it is not now. We will stop the kind of constant sniping at our protections for our workers that can come from foreign companies because they have the authority to try to sue to overturn what we do to keep our workers safe.

This is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.

MR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.

Before we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.

SEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.

LEHRER: Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. I'm Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October. Tonight's will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments. Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss. The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain. (APPLAUSE) Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, ""We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,"" end quote. With that in mind, the first lead question.

"Most heroin in U.S. now comes across Mexican border, Rob Portman says
Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.

The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)

Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.

Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico’s border, we were skeptical.

Sign up for PolitiFact texts

Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.

""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.""

The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.""

The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply s","0"
"Social Security Online History Pages
Supreme Court Case: Flemming vs. Nestor

Background to the Case:



The fact that workers contribute to the Social Security program's funding through a dedicated payroll tax establishes a unique connection between those tax payments and future benefits. More so than general federal income taxes can be said to establish ""rights"" to certain government services. This is often expressed in the idea that Social Security benefits are ""an earned right."" This is true enough in a moral and political sense. But like all federal entitlement programs, Congress can change the rules regarding eligibility--and it has done so many times over the years. The rules can be made more generous, or they can be made more restrictive. Benefits which are granted at one time can be withdrawn, as for example with student benefits, which were substantially scaled-back in the 1983 Amendments.



There has been a temptation throughout the program's history for some people to suppose that their FICA payroll taxes entitle them to a benefit in a legal, contractual sense. That is to say, if a person makes FICA contributions over a number of years, Congress cannot, according to this reasoning, change the rules in such a way that deprives a contributor of a promised future benefit. Under this reasoning, benefits under Social Security could probably only be increased, never decreased, if the Act could be amended at all. Congress clearly had no such limitation in mind when crafting the law. Section 1104 of the 1935 Act, entitled ""RESERVATION OF POWER,"" specifically said: ""The right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of this Act is hereby reserved to the Congress."" Even so, some have thought that this reservation was in some way unconstitutional. This is the issue finally settled by Flemming v. Nestor.



In this 1960 Supreme Court decision Nestor's denial of benefits was upheld even though he had contributed to the program for 19 years and was already receiving ","0"

"Clinton campaign’s claim that Trump would ‘force schools to allow guns in classrooms’
“FACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office.” — Hillary Clinton campaign post on Twitter, May 14, 2016 One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says “every voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump” is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are Trump’s widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.

That’s largely because Trump himself hasn’t talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didn’t respond to our request for more information, and doesn’t seem to have answered other media outlets’ requests, either.

Perhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances he’s described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.

The Facts

Congress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.

The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed","0"
"Obama: Mitt Romney refused to say whether he supports Lilly Ledbetter Act
Updated Thursday, October 25th, 2012 at 2:08 p.m.

Asked about fair pay for women during the second presidential debate, President Barack Obama was quick to bring up the first piece of legislation he signed into law -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.



Audience member Katherine Fenton asked Obama, ""In what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?""



Obama talked about being raised by a single mom who put herself through school and of his grandmother, who worked her way up from a bank secretary to a vice president but ""hit the glass ceiling.""



""She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn't complain. That's not what you did in that generation,"" he said at the debate at Hofstra University on Oct. 16, 2012. ""And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lilly Ledbetter bill.""



Romney responded by saying at one point he had more women in senior leadership positions than any other governor and that he wanted to help more women find jobs.



Obama jumped in, saying, ""Katherine, I just want to point out that when Gov. Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, ‘I'll get back to you.’ And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.""



Did Romney and his campaign really refuse to say whether he supported the law? Sort of.



The law, which Obama signed on Jan. 29, 2009, made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims but received little Republican support in Congress. It updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck. In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. tha","0"

"Remarks by President Trump in a Listening Session on Healthcare
Roosevelt Room

11:27 A.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all for being here today. It’s a great honor for you to share your personal stories of struggle under the enormous strain imposed on you by the very, very failed and failing Obamacare law. Secretary Price and I, along with my entire administration, and a lot of people in the Senate and a lot of people in the House are committed to repealing and replacing this disastrous law with a healthcare plan that lowers cost, expands choice, and ensures access for everyone.

You represent the millions of Americans who have seen their Obamacare premiums increase by double digits and even triple digits. In Arizona, the rates were over 116 percent last year -- 116 percent increase. And the deductibles are so high you don’t even get to use it.

Many Americans lost their plans and doctors altogether, and one-third of the counties -- think of it, one-third only have one insurer left. The insurance companies are fleeing. They’re gone; so many gone. The House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will provide you and your fellow citizens with more choices -- far more choices at lower cost. Americans should pick the plan they want. Now they’ll be able to pick the plan they want, they’ll be able to pick the doctor they want. They’ll be able to do a lot of things that the other plan was supposed to give and it never gave. You don’t pick your doctor, you don’t pick your plan -- you remember that one.

We’re not going to have one-size-fits-all. Instead, we’re going to be working to unleash the power of the private marketplace to let insurers come in and compete for your business. And you’ll see rates go down, down, down, and you’ll see plans go up, up, up. You’ll have a lot of choices.

What Carly is doing tonight Carly Fiorina 4 min read · Feb 7, 2016 -- 4 Listen Share

Date: February 6, 2016

Subject: ABC: Anyone But Carly

From: Frank F. Sadler, Campaign Manager

To: Friends of Carly

Despite what the media is telling you, it is clear that Carly deserved to be on the debate stage, both according to their arbitrary metrics — and the ones that actually matter:

* In an actual contest of voters, Carly came out ahead of Governors Christie and Kasich

* She has the same number of delegates as Governor Bush. Governor Christie has 0

* Carly is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash-on-hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined

* There is a ground game with paid staff in 12 states. In New Hampshire alone, CARLY for America has 12 full-time staff, 500 volunteer community captains and 77 canvassers.

* Carly has endorsements from leaders in 27 states. In New Hampshire alone, we have endorsements from 83 elected officials, political leaders, party activists, and business and community leaders.

* Recent polls — which are the standard by which ABC is making their decision about which candidates to include — show Carly ahead of multiple candidates on the stage. A WBUR poll released yesterday has Carly surging to 8%

We know how much this injustice outraged the voters of Iowa — whose votes were ignored — and the voters of New Hampshire, who don’t want the media and the political establishment unfairly winnowing the field before they get to vote. So we spoke with executives at ABC and political leaders at the RNC and made our case. But they decided to keep us off the stage to improve the chances of their favored candidates, despite what voters clearly wanted.

And it wasn’t just us. More than 35,000 voters signed a petition to get Carly on the stage. Conservative blog PJ Media polled their readers: 76% said Carly should be on stage. Fox host Greta Van Susteren polled her viewers and 80% agreed that she should be on sta","0"
